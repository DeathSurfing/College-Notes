 # Sufi and Bhakti Schools of Thought within Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)

## Core Definitions

### Sufism
Sufism is a mystical branch of Islam that focuses on the inward search for God and spiritual truth. It emphasizes love, devotion, and direct personal experience of divine reality. The term "Sufi" comes from the Arabic word "suf," which means wool, referring to the simple garments worn by early Sufis.

### Bhakti
Bhakti is a spiritual path in Hinduism that emphasizes devotion and love for a personal god or deity. It involves practices such as chanting (kirtan), meditation on divine names, and selfless service to others. The core belief is that through unconditional love and surrender to the divine, one can achieve spiritual liberation (moksha).

## Practical Applications

- **Zikr:** Remembering God through repetition of divine names or phrases. This practice is used to focus the heart and mind on the divine presence.
- **Silsila:** The chain of transmission in Sufi orders, which ensures the authenticity and continuity of spiritual teachings from master to disciple.

### Bhakti
- **Kirtan:** Devotional singing that involves repeating the names of God and focusing on the emotional and devotional aspects of the practice.
- **Puja:** Worship rituals performed in temples or at home, involving offerings to deities such as flowers, incense, and food.
- **Seva:** Selfless service to others, often practiced within temple communities or ashrams. This includes acts of charity, hospitality, and helping those in need.
