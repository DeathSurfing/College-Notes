 # Statements & Expressions in Computational Thinking

## Core Definitions

### Statement
In the context of computational thinking, a **statement** is a unit of code that performs an action. It can be thought of as a command given to the computer. Statements are fundamental building blocks used to construct programs and algorithms. They typically end with a semicolon (`;`) in many programming languages.

### Expression
An **expression**, on the other hand, is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value. Expressions do not perform actions but rather compute and return a result. For example, `2 + 3`, `a * b`, or `sin(x)` are all expressions in various programming languages.

## Practical Applications

### Statements
Statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They can be categorized into different types:
- **Assignment Statement**: Assigns a value to a variable (e.g., `x = 5`).
- **Control Statement**: Alters the flow of the program based on conditions or loops (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`).
- **Function Call Statement**: Invokes a function defined elsewhere in the code (e.g., `print("Hello, World!")`).

### Expressions
Expressions are used to perform calculations and computations within statements. They can be found in:
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (e.g., `x + y`, `a - b`).
- **Boolean Logic**: Conditions that evaluate to true or false (e.g., `x > 0`, `a == b`).
- **Function Calls**: Expressions can also include function calls that return a value (e.g., `sqrt(x)`, `length(str)`).

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### Computational Thinking
Statements and expressions are integral parts of computational thinking, which involves solving problems using computer science principles. They enable the creation of algorithms that can be executed by computers to perform various tasks.

- **Algorithm Design**: Statements define the steps in an algorithm, while expressions handle the data manipulation within those steps.
- **Programming Languages**: Both statements and expressions are core components of any programming language. They provide a way to structure code and perform operations.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Expressions are often used within statements to operate on data structures, while statements control the flow of algorithms.

## Simple Examples

### Statements
1. **Assignment Statement**
   ```python
   x = 5
   ```
2. **Control Statement (If-Else)**
   ```python
   if x > 0:
       print("Positive")
   else:
       print("Non-positive")
   ```
3. **Loop Statement**
   ```python
   for i in range(5):
       print(i)
   ```

### Expressions
1. **Arithmetic Expression**
   ```python
   2 + 3 * 4
   ```
2. **Boolean Expression**
   ```python
   x > 0 and y < 10
   ```
3. **Function Call Expression**
   ```python
   math.sqrt(x)
   ```

By understanding the distinction between statements and expressions, developers can write more efficient and effective code, leveraging the strengths of both to solve complex problems in computational thinking.
