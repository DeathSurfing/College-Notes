$t_n = \frac{(n - \frac{1}{2}) \lambda}{2}$
For $n = 10$:
$t_{10} = \frac{(10 - \frac{1}{2}) \times 5900 \times 10^{-10}}{2}$
$t_{10} = \frac{9.5 \times 5900 \times 10^{-10}}{2} = 2.8025 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 2.8025 \, \mu\text{m}$

# Q5)State and explain Malus' law. How is it used to calculate the intensity of polarized light after passing through a polarizer?

describes the behavior of light intensity when polarized light passes through a polarizing filter. It states that the intensity of polarized light after passing through a polarizer is proportional to the cosine square of the angle (ùúÉ) between the light's polarization direction and the axis of the polarizer.

The diagram above is assuming source of light as unpolarized
The mathematical formula for Mauls law is:$I = I_0 \cos^2(\theta)$

# Q6)What is the Broglie hypothesis? Derive the expression for the deBroglie wavelength of a particle and explain its significance. Find the deBroglie wavelength of an electron moving with a speed of $1√ó10^6$ m/s.

De Broglie's Hypothesis says that Matter consists of both the particle nature as well as wave nature.
De Broglie wavelength¬†$\lambda$¬†is given as $\lambda=\frac{h}{p}$, where¬†p¬†represents the particle momentum and can be written as
$p=mv$ 
making,
$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$
