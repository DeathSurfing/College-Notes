## Core Definitions

### Mechanics
- **Newton's Laws of Motion**: Fundamental principles governing the relationship between forces acting on a body and its motion.
  - First Law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an external force.
  - Second Law (\(F = ma\)): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration.
  - Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- **Kinematics**: Study of motion without considering the forces that cause it.
  - Equations of Motion: \(v = u + at\), \(s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2\), \(v^2 = u^2 + 2as\).
- **Energy**: The capacity to do work.
  - Kinetic Energy (\(KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\)): Energy possessed by a body due to its motion.
  - Potential Energy (\(PE = mgh\)): Energy possessed by a body due to its position or configuration.
- **Momentum**: The product of the mass and velocity of an object.
  - Conservation of Momentum: In a closed system, the total momentum is conserved.

### Electromagnetism
- **Electric Charge**: A fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electric or magnetic field.
- **Electric Current**: The rate of flow of electric charge past a point or through a surface.
  - Ohm's Law: \(V = IR\).
- **Magnetic Field**: A region around a magnet where the magnetic influence can be detected.
  - Faraday’s Law: The induced electromotive force (EMF) in any closed circuit is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.
- **Electromagnetic Waves**: Waves formed by oscillating electric and magnetic fields.
  - Maxwell’s Equations: Four fundamental equations that describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other.

### Optics
- **Light**: Electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye.
  - Speed of Light (\(c\)): The speed at which light travels in a vacuum, approximately \(3 \times 10^8\) meters per second.
- **Reflection**: The change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated.
  - Laws of Reflection: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
- **Refraction**: The change in direction of a wave due to a change in its transmission medium.
  - Snell’s Law: \(\frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}\).

### Thermodynamics
- **Temperature**: A physical property that quantitatively expresses the common sensation of hot and cold.
  - Absolute Zero: The lowest possible temperature, approximately \(-273.15^\circ\) Celsius or \(0\) Kelvin.
- **Heat**: Energy transferred from one object to another due solely to a difference in temperature.
  - Specific Heat Capacity: The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of substance by one degree.
- **Entropy**: A measure of disorder or randomness in a system.
  - Second Law of Thermodynamics: The total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all processes are reversible.
