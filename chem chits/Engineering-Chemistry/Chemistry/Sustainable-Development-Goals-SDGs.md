## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - An Engineering & Chemistry Perspective

This document explores the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the lens of engineering and chemistry, outlining their core definitions, practical applications, relationships to foundational concepts, and providing simple examples. The focus is on how these disciplines can contribute to achieving these global goals.

### 1. Core Definitions & Overview

The **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, adopted by the UN in 2015, are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all." They address a wide range of social, economic, and environmental challenges, aiming for a holistic approach to development.  The overarching principle is to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Sustainability:** The ability to maintain a process or state indefinitely.  In the context of the SDGs, it implies balancing economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection.
* **Interconnectedness:** The SDGs are not isolated goals; progress in one area often impacts others.  For example, improving access to clean water (SDG 6) can positively influence health (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4).
* **Leave No One Behind:** A core tenet emphasizing equitable access to resources and opportunities for all, particularly vulnerable populations.
