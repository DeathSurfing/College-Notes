# Electrical Supply

___

## Types of Electrical Supply


- DC:  Direct current![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 2.24.42 PM.png]]
- AC: Alternative Current![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 2.25.09 PM.png]]



## Resistance:
- Opposes the flow of current 
- Unit: Ohms 
	- $$\Omega$$
- The representation of resistance is either (R or r)
- The Graphical representation of resistance is

## Ohm's Law:
$$V=IR$$

## Current-voltage properties properties:
- In series current is the same across all resistors
- In parallel voltage is the same across all resistors

## Series Connection:

$$V=IR$$
$$V_1+V_2=V_T$$
$$IR_1\cdot IR_2=IR_T$$
$$R_1+R_2=R_T$$

## Parralel Connection:

$$V=IR$$
$$I_1+I_2=I_T$$
$$\frac{V}{R_1}+\frac{V}{R_2}=\frac{V}{R_T}$$
$$\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}=\frac{1}{R_T}$$
