# P-N Junction Diode

___

- A semi conductor that allows electric current to flow in one direction only.
## Construction of a P-N junction Dione
- By making P-type semi conductors and N-type semi conductors in close proximity
- Made by doping silicon of either trivalent(for n type) or 5 valence electron(p type).

## Biasing
- Applying a external voltage to a P-N junction diode
	- Forward biasing is when the P side is connected to the positive side and N side is connected to negative side of a battery; Creates a narrow depletion region
	- Reverse Bias P type is connected to negative and P type is connected to the positive side of a battery; Creates a wide narrow depletion region

## Applications
- Rectifiers
- Voltage Regulation
- LED's
- IC's
