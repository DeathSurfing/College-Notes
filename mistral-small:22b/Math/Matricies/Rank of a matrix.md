# Rank of a matrix

## Rank of a matrix:
- The maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns.

$$Denoted\ by\ \rho(A)$$

### Methods to find a rank of a matrix
- Using Row Echelon form
- Using  Reduced Row Echelon Form
- Minors of discriminants


#### Using Row Reduction Echelon forms
- Transform the matrix into a Row Echelon form
- Determine the rank using the non zero rows

#### Minors of discriminants
- Find the largest square sub matrix (minor) with a non zero determinant
- Only for square matrices

#### Importance of Rank of matrix (USES)
- The Rank of a unit matrix $m\times n$ is $m\ or \ n$
- If a matrix A is of order $m\times n$ then $\rho(A) = min(m,n)$
- If a matrix A is of order $m\times n$ and $|A| \neq 0$ thus $\rho(A)=m$
- If a matrix A is of order $m\times n$ and $|A|=0$ then $\rho(A)$ will be lesser than m
