# To find the rank of a matrix and a augmented matrix

##  To find the rank of a matrix and a augmented matrix

- If $\rho(A)=\rho[A|B]=r=n(Number\ of \ unknowns)$
	- Then System is consistent with unique solution
- If $\rho(A)=\rho[A|B]=r<n(Number\ of \ unknowns)$
	- Then System is consistent with infinite solutions
	- $n-r+1$ Solutions are linearly independent 
- If $\rho(A)\not = \rho(A|B)$
	- Then the System has no solutions
