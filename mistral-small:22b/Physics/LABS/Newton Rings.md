| ---- | -------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1    | Traveling Microscope | 1        |         |
| 2    | Sodium Vapour lamp   | 1        |         |
| 3    | Plano Convex Lens    | 1        |         |
| 4    | Plane Glass plate    | 1        |         |
| 5    | Magnifying lens      | 1        |         |

# Theory:
### Newton's Rings and Interference of Light

1. **Formation of Newton's Rings:**
   - A plano-convex lens placed on a plane glass plate forms an air film of increasing thickness.
   - Monochromatic light falling normally creates a pattern of alternate light and dark circular rings due to interference.
   - The circular symmetry of the air film results in circular fringes.

2. **Conditions for Sustained Interference:**
   - **Coherent Sources:** Must maintain a constant phase difference.
   - **Monochromatic Light:** Light must consist of a single wavelength.

3. **Interference Conditions in Experiments:**
   - **Young's Double Slit and Fresnel's Biprism:**
     - Dark fringes occur at $d \sin \theta = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$ (where $(m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$).
     - Interference arises from the division of wavefront and amplitude.

4. **Interference in Thin Films:**
   - For a film of uniform thickness \(t\) and refractive index \(n\), with nearly normal light rays:
     - **Destructive Interference:** Occurs when $2nt = m\lambda$ (where $m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$).
     - For air, $n = 1$.

5. **Observations:**
   - Viewing through a microscope reveals alternate bright (yellow) and dark rings.
   - Adjustments to the reflecting glass plate and light source can improve the definition of the rings.
   - The innermost rings may not appear perfectly circular and are generally avoided in observations.

# Procedure:
- Set the point of intersection of the cross wires at the center of the ring system.
- Rotate the microscope about its axis:
  - Position one cross wire at right angles to the direction of motion.
  - Position the other cross wire parallel to the direction of motion.
- Set the vertical cross wire tangential to the 15th dark ring on the left side of the central dark spot (counting the central dark spot as zero).
- Record the microscope position:
  - The main scale has 90 millimeters engraved on it.
  - The least count is ${1 \, \text{mm}/100 = 0.01 \, \text{mm}}$.
  - When the micrometer head is turned through one complete revolution, it moves ${1 \, \text{mm}}$ on the main scale.
- To take a reading, record it as follows:
  - ${\text{M.S.R in mm} + x (0.01 \, \text{mm})}$, where $x$ is the number indicated on the micrometer head.
- Repeat the procedure until the 5th dark ring on the left appears in the field of view.
- Continue moving the screw in the same direction until the vertical cross wire is tangential to:
  - The 5th dark ring on the right.
  - The 6th dark ring on the right.
  - Continue until reaching the 15th dark ring on the right.
- Ensure the direction of screw rotation remains consistent throughout the procedure.

# Result:

$R=\frac{D_{n+p}^2-D_{n}^2}{4p\lambda}$
$R_{5,3}=\frac{0.160048-0.12226212}{8\times 5893\times 10^-8}=~80.15cm$

$R_{7,5}=97.043cm$
$R_{7,3}=177.19cm$

Average $R$: 118.07 cm

# Error Prorogation:
$\text{Standard Deviation:}42.329$


# Precautions:
1. The glass plate surface and the lens surface must be thoroughly cleaned otherwise
the fringes will not be bright and sharp.
2. The microscope’s eyepiece must be properly focused on its crosswire. The
microscope should be given motion only along one direction to avoid backlash errors.
3. The planoconvex lens should be of a large radius of curvature.
