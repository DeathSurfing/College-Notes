>Forces are said to be pushes or pulls. This implies a contact between
one object and another. But forces also arise through field interactions,
for example, a mass interacts with a gravitational field. Newtonâ€™s three
laws of motion describe the interaction between an object and a force.
>Uniform velocity has both magnitude and direction, so both must be
unchanging for the motion to be uniform.
>For acceleration to occur an object must be subject to a net external force.
When more than one external force acts on a body, you need to sum
the vectors using the rules for vector addition. When the forces cancel
out to give zero resultant force (net force) the body is in translational
equilibrium. When the forces do not cancel out to give zero resultant
force, the forces are unbalanced

**TLDR:** Forces are push or pull or field interactions , For acceleration to occur the forces must be imbalanced , Uniform velocity requires both magnitude and direction of the vector to be unchanging .
