The idea that nothing can be known to certainty; there is always uncertainty in every claim. It questions the reliability of our senses and our ability to reason and asks if there any beliefs or values that society as a hole can uphold. 

## Common questions:
- Can we know anything to certainty?
- Can we measure anything accurately to its every minute detail?
- Are there things that can  never be measured?
- What is the speed of light?
