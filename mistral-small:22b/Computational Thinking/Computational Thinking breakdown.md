# Computational Thinking breakdown

___

## What is computational thinking?
Computational thinking is "a systematic approach to solving complex problems by drawing upon principles from computer science".
- Breaking down problems into smaller components "Decomposition"
- Recognising patterns
- Devising algorithms
- Abstracting that is extracting relevant data.

## Computational Thinking key concepts:
- Decomposition
	- Breakdown data and problems into smaller parts
- Pattern Recognition
	- Observe patterns and trends in data
- Abstraction
	- Determine what steps are needed to solve a problem
- Algorithm
	- Remove details and extract relevant information


## Importance of computational thinking
- To improve problem solving skills
- Interdisciplinary applications between multiple different subjects 
- Preparation for the future
- Enhancing collaboration
