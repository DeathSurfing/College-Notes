### Abstraction:
#### Functional Abstraction
- The hiding of the internals of a function or method to preserve the core essence of the program to the user

#### Data Abstraction:
- Hiding data details such as class, types, etc...

- Higher level functions have no idea of what lower level functions do ; they follow a layered design
