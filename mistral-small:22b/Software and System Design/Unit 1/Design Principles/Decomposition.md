# Decomposition

### Decomposition:
- Breaking a larger problem into logical sub units (smaller parts)
- Followed by finding solutions for those smaller parts (Divide and conqueror)
- Benifits:
	- Easier to understand
	- Testing modification is easier
	- Expansion is easier
- Cons:
	- Increases the complexity of the problem; due to the increase in sub problems cost and complexity would increase
