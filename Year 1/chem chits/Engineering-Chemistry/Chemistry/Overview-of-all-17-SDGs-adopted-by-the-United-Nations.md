## The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): An Engineering & Chemistry Perspective

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a universal call to action to protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. While seemingly broad, the SDGs have profound implications and offer numerous opportunities for innovation and application within engineering and chemistry. This document provides a comprehensive overview of each goal, emphasizing their relevance to these disciplines.

**I. Core Definitions & Underlying Concepts**

*   **Sustainable Development:** Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This concept rests on three pillars: economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection.
*   **Interconnectedness:** The SDGs are not isolated goals. Progress in one area often depends on progress in others.  This highlights the need for integrated solutions and systems thinking.
*   **Systems Thinking:** Recognizing that complex problems require understanding the interdependencies and feedback loops within a system. Essential for designing effective SDG-related interventions.
*   **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA):** A methodology used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product, process, or service across its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal.  Crucial for SDG-aligned engineering design.
*   **Green Chemistry:** The design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. A core principle underpinning many SDG applications.
