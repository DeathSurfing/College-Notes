- Divide the projects into sectors or quadrants
	- Identify resolve and risks
	- Determine Objectives
	- Customer evaluation of prototype
	- Develop next levels of products
- Iterate over these quadrants until the loop is over
	- Highly Flexible and adaptable
	- Suitable for large and complex projects
