- **Holistic Approach**: All six schools contribute to a holistic understanding of reality, encompassing logic, metaphysics, psychology, and ethics.
- **Interconnectedness**: These schools often complement each other; for example, Yoga practices are rooted in Sāṅkhya philosophy, and Vedānta builds upon the foundations laid by Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika.

### Hinduism
- **Philosophical Basis**: The six orthodox schools form the philosophical basis of Hinduism, providing diverse perspectives on the nature of reality, self, and liberation.
