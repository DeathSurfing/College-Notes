## Core Definitions

The Bhakti movement, also known as the Bhakti cult or Bhakti tradition, is a devotional form of Hinduism that emphasizes intense emotional attachment and devotion to a personal god. The term "Bhakti" originates from Sanskrit and translates to "devotion," "worship," or "faith." This movement emerged in India during the 6th century CE, gaining significant momentum between the 15th and 18th centuries.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Personal Devotion**: Focuses on a personal relationship with a deity rather than ritualistic adherence.
- **Inclusivity**: Promotes inclusivity by challenging caste systems, allowing people from all backgrounds to participate.
- **Simplicity**: Encourages simple, heartfelt worship that can be performed anywhere and at any time.
- **Emotional Intensity**: Emphasizes the emotional experience of devotion over intellectual understanding or ritualistic adherence.

## Practical Applications

### Devotional Practices:
1. **Kirtan (Chanting)**: Group singing of hymns and mantras to invoke divine presence.
2. **Bhajans (Devotional Songs)**: Lyrical compositions expressing love and devotion to deities, often in regional languages.
3. **Meditation**: Focused contemplation on the form or essence of a chosen deity.
4. **Pilgrimage**: Visiting holy sites to strengthen one's faith and connection with the divine.
5. **Charitable Works**: Performing acts of service (seva) as an expression of devotion and love for God.

### Social Impact:
- **Caste Reform**: Challenged and sometimes subverted the rigid caste system by promoting equality among devotees.
- **Social Cohesion**: Fostered unity and harmony across different social strata through shared devotional practices.
- **Literary Contributions**: Produced a rich body of literature in regional languages, including poetry, prose, and songs.

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### Indian Knowledge System (IKS)
The Bhakti movement is deeply rooted within the broader framework of the Indian Knowledge System (IKS), which encompasses diverse philosophical, spiritual, and cultural traditions.

1. **Philosophy**: Draws from various schools of thought such as Advaita Vedanta, Vaishnavism, and Shaivism.
2. **Mythology**: Incorporates stories and legends from Hindu mythology to illustrate devotional themes.
3. **Literature**: Utilizes regional languages and literary forms to disseminate teachings and practices.
4. **Cultural Integration**: Blends seamlessly with local customs, festivals, and artistic expressions.

### Connection to Other Hindu Traditions:
- **Vedic Tradition**: While not strictly Vedic, Bhakti incorporates elements from the Vedas, such as hymns and mantras.
- **Yoga**: Complements yogic practices by focusing on emotional and devotional aspects of spirituality.
- **Tantra**: Shares some rituals and symbolism with Tantric traditions, though Bhakti emphasizes devotion over ritual complexity.

## Simple Examples

### Poetic Expressions:
**Mirabai (1498–1547)**, a prominent figure of the Bhakti movement, wrote:
```
Mira says, "I am a slave of my Lord;
He is the protector of the humble."
```
This verse exemplifies the intense personal devotion characteristic of the Bhakti tradition.

### Devotional Songs:
**Kabir (1440–1518)**, another influential poet, composed songs like:
```
O mind, the Lord is within you;
Seek Him there and you shall find.
```
These lyrics illustrate the internal focus and simplicity of Bhakti practices.

### Modern Influences:
In contemporary times, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, continues to propagate Bhakti teachings globally through practices such as kirtan and the distribution of spiritual literature.

The Bhakti movement's enduring legacy lies in its ability to make divine love accessible and meaningful across various social and cultural contexts, fostering a deep sense of personal connection with the divine.
