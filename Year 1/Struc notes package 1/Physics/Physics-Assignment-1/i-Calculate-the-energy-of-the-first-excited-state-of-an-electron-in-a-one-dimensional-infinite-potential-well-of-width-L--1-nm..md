 # Calculate the Energy of the First Excited State of an Electron in a One-Dimensional Infinite Potential Well

## Introduction
In quantum mechanics, the infinite potential well is a fundamental concept used to describe the behavior of particles within confined spaces. This tutorial will guide you through calculating the energy of the first excited state of an electron in a one-dimensional infinite potential well with a width \( L = 1 \) nm.

## Core Definitions

### Infinite Potential Well
An infinite potential well is a region where the potential energy \( V(x) \) is zero inside the well and infinite outside. This means that particles cannot escape from the well. The well is typically defined by two boundaries, \( x = 0 \) and \( x = L \).

### First Excited State
The first excited state refers to the second lowest energy level of a quantum system. In an infinite potential well, the ground state (lowest energy level) has zero nodes in the wavefunction, while the first excited state has one node in the middle of the well.

## Practical Applications

### Quantum Dots
Infinite potential wells are used to model quantum dots, which are nanoscale structures with unique electronic and optical properties. Understanding the energy levels in these systems is crucial for designing and optimizing semiconductor devices.

### Atomic Spectroscopy
The infinite potential well model can also be applied to understand the energy levels of electrons in atoms, particularly in hydrogen-like species where electrons are confined within a spherical potential well.

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### Schrödinger Equation
The energy levels in an infinite potential well are derived from solving the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation:
\[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} = E\psi(x) \]
where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant, \( m \) is the mass of the particle, and \( \psi(x) \) is the wavefunction.

### Boundary Conditions
For an infinite potential well, the boundary conditions are:
\[ \psi(0) = 0 \]
\[ \psi(L) = 0 \]
These conditions ensure that the wavefunction vanishes at the boundaries of the well.

## Calculation

### Wavefunction and Energy Levels
The general solution to the Schrödinger equation for an infinite potential well is:
\[ \psi(x) = A \sin(kx) + B \cos(kx) \]
where \( k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} \). Given the boundary conditions, we find that:
\[ \psi(0) = 0 \implies B = 0 \]
\[ \psi(L) = 0 \implies kL = n\pi \]
where \( n \) is an integer.

### Energy of the First Excited State
For the first excited state (\( n = 1 \)):
\[ E_1 = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \]
Substituting \( L = 1 \) nm and using \( m \approx 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \) kg (mass of an electron):
\[ E_1 = \frac{1^2 \pi^2 (1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times (1 \times 10^{-9})^2} \]
\[ E_1 = \frac{1.168 \times 10^{-68}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} \]
\[ E_1 \approx 6.41 \times 10^{-39} \, \text{J} \]

### Conversion to eV
To convert the energy from Joules to electronvolts (eV), use \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):
\[ E_1 \approx \frac{6.41 \times 10^{-39}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \]
\[ E_1 \approx 4.00 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{eV} \]

## Simple Example

### Hydrogen Atom
Consider the simplest atom, hydrogen (H). The electron in a hydrogen atom can be approximated as being confined within an infinite potential well with \( L \approx 1 \) Å (0.1 nm). Calculating the energy of the first excited state:
\[ E_1 = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \]
Using \( L = 0.1 \) nm, we find that the energy is significantly higher due to the smaller confinement size.

## Conclusion
Calculating the energy of the first excited state in a one-dimensional infinite potential well involves solving the Schrödinger equation with appropriate boundary conditions. This model has wide applications in quantum mechanics and nanotechnology, providing insights into the behavior of particles in confined spaces.
