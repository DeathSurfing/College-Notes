#### Simple Examples

1. **Newton's Second Law of Motion:**
   - Example: Calculating the force needed to accelerate a car. If a car of mass \(1500 \, \text{kg}\) needs to be accelerated at \(2 \, \text{m/s}^2\), the required force is:
     \[
     F = ma = 1500 \, \text{kg} \times 2 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 3000 \, \text{N}
     \]

2. **Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence:**
   - Example: Converting mass to energy in a nuclear reaction. If \(1 \, \text{kg}\) of matter is converted into energy, the amount of energy released is:
     \[
     E = mc^2 = 1 \, \text{kg} \times (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{J}
     \]

3. **Ohm's Law:**
   - Example: Calculating the voltage across a resistor. If a current of \(2 \, \text{A}\) flows through a resistor with a resistance of \(5 \, \Omega\), the voltage drop is:
     \[
     V = IR = 2 \, \text{A} \times 5 \, \Omega = 10 \, \text{V}
     \]

4. **Universal Law of Gravitation:**
   - Example: Calculating the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. If the mass of the Earth is \(5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}\) and the mass of the Moon is \(7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg}\), and the average distance between them is \(3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}\), the force is:
     \[
     F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \frac{5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \times 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg}}{(3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m})^2} = 1.98 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N}
     \]

5. **Ideal Gas Law:**
   - Example: Calculating the pressure of a gas. If \(0.5 \, \text{mol}\) of an ideal gas is in a \(2 \, \text{L}\) container at \(300 \, \text{K}\), the pressure is:
     \[
     PV = nRT \implies P = \frac{nRT}{V} = \frac{0.5 \, \text{mol} \times 8.31 \, \text{J/mol} \cdot \text{K} \times 300 \, \text{K}}{2 \, \text{L}} = 623.25 \, \text{Pa}
