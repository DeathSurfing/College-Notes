 # High Level Design

## Introduction
High level design (HLD) is a crucial phase in software and system development that focuses on the overall structure of a system. It provides an abstract view of the system, emphasizing the major components, their interactions, and the data they process. This stage sets the foundation for subsequent detailed design and implementation phases.

## Core Definitions
### What is High Level Design?
High level design (HLD) is a top-down approach to system architecture that outlines the primary components of a system without delving into the intricate details. It serves as a blueprint, guiding developers in understanding the system's major functionalities and how they interrelate.

### Key Components
1. **Modules/Components**: Identifies the main parts of the system.
2. **Interfaces**: Defines how these components interact with each other.
3. **Data Flow**: Illustrates the movement of data between modules.
4. **Control Flow**: Depicts the sequence in which operations are performed.
5. **Dependencies**: Highlights external systems or resources on which the system depends.

## Practical Applications
### Software Development
In software development, HLD is used to create a high-level architecture that outlines the major components of an application, such as the user interface, business logic, and database. This helps in managing complexity and ensuring that all team members have a common understanding of the system's structure.

### System Design
For system design, HLD is essential for defining the hardware and software components of a system, their interactions, and the data flow between them. This is crucial in fields like embedded systems, where optimizing performance and resource utilization are critical.

### Network Architecture
In network architecture, HLD provides an overview of the network topology, including routers, switches, firewalls, and servers. It helps in planning the network layout, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## Relationships to Parent Concepts
### Software-and-System Design
High level design is a fundamental concept within software and system design. It builds on top of other foundational concepts such as requirements gathering and system analysis. The output from HLD often serves as input for the detailed design phase, where more specific technical decisions are made.

### Unit-1: Introduction to Software Design
In the context of a unit focused on software design, HLD is introduced early to provide students with a broad understanding of how systems are structured before delving into more granular aspects such as object-oriented design or database schema design.

## Simple Examples
### Example 1: E-commerce Website
**Components**:
- User Interface (UI)
- Business Logic Layer
- Database

**Interfaces and Data Flow**:
- Users interact with the UI, which sends requests to the Business Logic Layer.
- The Business Logic Layer processes these requests and interacts with the Database for data storage and retrieval.

**Control Flow**:
1. User logs in via the UI.
2. The UI sends a request to the Business Logic Layer.
3. The Business Logic Layer verifies the credentials with the Database.
4. If verified, the user is granted access.

### Example 2: Traffic Light System
**Components**:
- Sensors (to detect vehicles)
- Controller (to manage light sequences)
- Lights (red, yellow, green)

**Interfaces and Data Flow**:
- Sensors send data to the Controller.
- The Controller processes this data and sends commands to the Lights.

**Control Flow**:
1. Sensors detect a vehicle.
2. The Controller receives the signal and changes the light sequence from green to yellow, then red.
3. After a set time, the Controller changes the lights back to green.

## Conclusion
High level design is an essential phase in software and system development that provides a clear overview of the system's architecture. By defining the major components, their interactions, and data flow, HLD ensures that developers have a common understanding of the system, which is crucial for effective collaboration and successful project execution.
