## Core Definitions

Low level design (LLD) is a crucial stage in the software development lifecycle, following high level design (HLD). It involves translating the abstract entities and components described in HLD into more concrete and implementable units. LLD focuses on defining the internal structure of each component, detailing how they interact with each other, and specifying the data structures and algorithms to be used.

Key aspects of low level design include:
- **Detailed Specifications**: Providing precise details about each module or unit, including input/output parameters, error handling, and performance criteria.
- **Data Structures**: Choosing appropriate data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees) to store and manipulate data efficiently.
- **Algorithms**: Selecting suitable algorithms for various operations within the software system.
- **Interface Definition**: Defining interfaces between different modules or components to ensure smooth communication and interaction.

## Practical Applications

### Software Development
In software development, LLD is essential for breaking down complex systems into manageable pieces. Developers create detailed design documents that serve as blueprints for coding. These designs include pseudocode, flowcharts, and UML diagrams to clarify the system's behavior and structure.

### System Design
For system-level design, LLD helps in optimizing hardware resources. It involves choosing appropriate data structures and algorithms that can be efficiently implemented on the target hardware platform. This ensures that the system performs well under various conditions.

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### High Level Design (HLD)
Low level design is directly related to high level design. While HLD focuses on the overall architecture and major components of a system, LLD delves into the specifics of how these components are implemented. The output of HLD serves as the input for LLD, providing a framework that LLD builds upon with detailed specifications.

### Software-and-System-Design
Within the broader context of software and system design, LLD plays a pivotal role in bridging the gap between abstract concepts and practical implementations. It ensures that the theoretical foundations laid out in HLD are translated into efficient and effective code or hardware configurations.

## Simple Examples

### Example 1: Library Management System
**High Level Design**: The system consists of modules for user management, book cataloging, and loan tracking.

**Low Level Design**:
- **User Management Module**:
  - Data Structure: Hash table to store user data (e.g., username, password, contact information).
  - Algorithm: Hashing for quick lookup of users.
  - Interface: `addUser(username, password)`, `removeUser(username)`, `getUserDetails(username)`.

- **Book Cataloging Module**:
  - Data Structure: Binary search tree to store book data (e.g., ISBN, title, author).
  - Algorithm: Binary search for efficient retrieval of books.
  - Interface: `addBook(ISBN, title, author)`, `removeBook(ISBN)`, `searchBooks(title)`.

### Example 2: Traffic Light Control System
**High Level Design**: The system manages traffic lights at intersections.

**Low Level Design**:
- **Traffic Light Controller Module**:
  - Data Structure: Array to represent different states of the traffic light (red, yellow, green).
  - Algorithm: Finite state machine to control the sequence of traffic lights.
  - Interface: `changeLight()`, `getCurrentState()`.

- **Sensor Module**:
  - Data Structure: Queue to store sensor data from various points.
  - Algorithm: FIFO for processing sensor data in the order they are received.
  - Interface: `enqueue(sensorData)`, `dequeue()`.

By following these steps and adhering to the principles of low level design, developers can create robust, efficient, and maintainable software systems.
