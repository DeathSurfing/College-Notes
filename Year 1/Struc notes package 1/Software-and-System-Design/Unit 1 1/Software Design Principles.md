## Software Design Principles
- Manage complexity (reducing complexity to reduce effort and minimize errors)
- Decomposition/divide and conquer (Making problems smaller)
- Abstraction (Reducing details to allow focus on primary problem)
- Modularity (Separating software into manageable, self contained modules)
