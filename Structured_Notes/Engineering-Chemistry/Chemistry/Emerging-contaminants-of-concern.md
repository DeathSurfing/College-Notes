## Emerging Contaminants of Concern: A Chemical Engineering & Chemistry Perspective

This document explores emerging contaminants of concern (ECCs), focusing on their chemical nature, engineering challenges in detection and removal, and their relationship to broader environmental chemistry principles.  ECCs represent a growing area of concern due to their potential adverse effects on human health and ecosystems, often occurring at low concentrations and exhibiting complex behavior.

### 1. Core Definitions & Classification

**1.1. What are Emerging Contaminants of Concern (ECCs)?**

ECCs are chemical or biological substances that are not routinely monitored in the environment, but have the potential to cause harm. They are “emerging” because their presence and potential impacts are relatively new discoveries, often due to advances in analytical techniques or increased awareness of previously unrecognized risks.  They are "of concern" due to potential adverse effects, even at low concentrations.

**1.2. Key Characteristics of ECCs:**

* **Low Environmental Concentrations:** Often detected in trace amounts (ng/L to µg/L).
* **Complex Behavior:**  May undergo transformations (e.g., degradation, sorption) in the environment, altering their toxicity and persistence.
* **Limited Regulatory Oversight:**  Often lack established water quality standards or treatment guidelines.
* **Diverse Chemical Structures & Sources:**  Can originate from a wide range of human activities.

**1.3. Classification of ECCs:**

ECCs can be broadly categorized based on their source and chemical nature:

* **Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs):**  Drugs, hormones, cosmetics, fragrances.  Sources: Wastewater treatment plant effluent, agricultural runoff.
* **Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS):**  Synthetic chemicals used in various industrial and consumer products (e.g., non-stick cookware, firefighting foam).  Sources: Industrial discharge, contaminated sites, consumer products.
* **Microplastics:**  Small plastic particles resulting from the breakdown of larger plastic items. Sources:  Wastewater, atmospheric deposition, agricultural practices.
* **Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs):**  Chemicals that interfere with the endocrine system, potentially affecting hormone regulation.  Examples: Bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates.
* **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Pollutants:**  Antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance genes released into the environment. Sources: Wastewater, agricultural runoff.
* **Nanomaterials:**  Engineered materials with dimensions on the nanometer scale. Sources: Industrial processes, consumer products.
* **Legacy Pollutants with Newly Recognized Impacts:**  Certain pesticides or industrial chemicals that were previously considered relatively benign but are now linked to adverse health effects.


### 2. Relationships to Parent Concepts (Engineering & Chemistry)

**2.1. Environmental Chemistry Foundation:**

* **Fate and Transport:** ECC behavior is governed by fundamental principles of environmental chemistry:
    * **Sorption:**  The binding of ECCs to soil and sediment particles influences their mobility and bioavailability.  (Relationship to: *Adsorption isotherms, Freundlich/Langmuir models*)
    * **Degradation:**  Chemical (hydrolysis, oxidation) and biological (biodegradation) processes can transform ECCs, altering their toxicity. (Relationship to: *Reaction kinetics, microbial metabolism*)
    * **Volatilization:**  The transfer of ECCs from water to the atmosphere. (Relationship to: *Henry's Law, vapor pressure*)
    * **Bioaccumulation & Biomagnification:**  The accumulation of ECCs in living organisms and their increasing concentration as they move up the food chain. (Relationship to: *Partition coefficients, trophic levels*)
* **Water Chemistry:**  pH, ionic strength, and the presence of other dissolved substances can significantly influence ECC behavior. (Relationship to: *Acid-base chemistry, solubility rules*)

**2.2. Chemical Engineering Applications:**

* **Analytical Chemistry:**  Developing sensitive and selective analytical methods for ECC detection and quantification is crucial. (Relationship to: *Chromatography (GC-MS, LC-MS), Spectroscopy (UV-Vis, Fluorescence)*)
* **Water & Wastewater Treatment:**  Designing and optimizing treatment processes to remove ECCs from water and wastewater is a major engineering challenge. (Relationship to: *Mass transfer, reaction engineering, separation processes*)
    * **Activated Carbon Adsorption:**  Effective for removing many organic ECCs. (Relationship to: *Adsorption equilibrium, pore size distribution*)
    * **Membrane Filtration (Reverse Osmosis, Nanofiltration):**  Can remove a wide range of ECCs, including PFAS and microplastics. (Relationship to: *Membrane science, pressure-driven processes*)
    * **Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs):**  Utilize oxidants (e.g., ozone, hydrogen peroxide) to degrade ECCs. (Relationship to: *Chemical kinetics, reactor design*)
    * **Biological Treatment:**  Employing microorganisms to biodegrade ECCs. (Relationship to: *Microbial kinetics, bioreactor design*)
* **Process Modeling & Simulation:**  Using computational tools to predict ECC fate and transport and to optimize treatment processes. (Relationship to: *Fluid mechanics, heat transfer, reaction kinetics*)



### 3. Practical Applications & Examples

**3.1. PFAS Remediation:**

* **Challenge:** PFAS are extremely persistent and mobile in the environment, and conventional water treatment methods are often ineffective.
* **Engineering Solutions:**
    * **Activated Carbon Adsorption:** While initially effective, activated carbon can become saturated and require frequent replacement.
    * **Ion Exchange Resins:**  More selective for PFAS than activated carbon.
    * **Reverse Osmosis (RO):**  Highly effective but can generate a concentrated waste stream requiring further treatment.
    * **Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) with Enhanced Adsorption:**  Research into modified GAC with increased PFAS affinity.
* **Chemistry Connection:** Understanding the strong carbon-fluorine bonds and their resistance to degradation is critical for developing effective remediation strategies.

**3.2. Microplastic Removal:**

* **Challenge:** Microplastics are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and pose a threat to aquatic life and potentially human health.
* **Engineering Solutions:**
    * **Membrane Filtration:**  Microfiltration and ultrafiltration can remove larger microplastics.
    * **Coagulation-Flocculation:**  Aggregating microplastics into larger particles for easier removal.
    * **Biofilms:**  Using microorganisms to capture and degrade microplastics.
* **Chemistry Connection:**  The polymer chemistry of microplastics influences their behavior and susceptibility to degradation.

**3.3. Pharmaceutical Removal:**

* **Challenge:** PPCPs are often not completely removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants, leading to their release into surface waters.
* **Engineering Solutions:**
    * **Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs):**  Effective for degrading many PPCPs.
    * **Constructed Wetlands:**  Utilize natural processes to remove PPCPs.
    * **Ozonation:**  Oxidizes many pharmaceuticals.
* **Chemistry Connection:**  Understanding the chemical structures and degradation pathways of PPCPs is essential for designing effective treatment strategies.
