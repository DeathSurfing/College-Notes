* **Secondary Energy:** Energy derived from primary sources through conversion processes. Examples: electricity, gasoline, hydrogen.
* **Energy Consumption:** The total amount of energy used by a sector, country, or globally.
* **Energy Intensity:** Energy consumption per unit of economic output (e.g., GDP).  Indicates efficiency.
* **Energy Security:**  Reliable access to energy sources at affordable prices, minimizing geopolitical vulnerabilities.
* **Carbon Footprint:** The total greenhouse gas emissions caused by an individual, organization, or product.
* **Renewable Energy:** Energy derived from sources that are naturally replenished, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass.
* **Fossil Fuels:** Energy sources formed from the remains of ancient organisms (coal, oil, natural gas).
* **Energy Mix:** The proportion of different primary energy sources used in a region or country.

**2. Current Global Energy Landscape: A Snapshot (2023-2024)**

* **Dominant Sources:** Fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) continue to dominate the global energy mix, accounting for approximately 80% of primary energy consumption.
    * **Oil:** Remains crucial for transportation and petrochemicals.
    * **Coal:** Primarily used for electricity generation and industrial processes (steel, cement).
    * **Natural Gas:** Increasingly important for power generation, heating, and as a feedstock for chemicals.
* **Growing Renewables:** Renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, biomass, geothermal) are experiencing significant growth, driven by technological advancements, policy support, and decreasing costs.  Solar and wind are leading the charge.
* **Geographic Distribution:** Energy consumption is heavily concentrated in developed countries and rapidly developing economies like China and India.
    * **China:** Largest energy consumer globally, heavily reliant on coal.
    * **United States:** Second-largest consumer, with a more diversified mix.
    * **India:** Rapidly increasing consumption driven by economic growth and population increase.
* **Regional Variations:** Energy mixes vary significantly by region, reflecting resource availability, economic development, and policy priorities.
* **Recent Trends:**
    * **Increased LNG Trade:**  Driven by geopolitical events and shifting energy demand.
    * **Electrification:**  Growing trend to replace fossil fuel-based processes with electricity.
    * **Hydrogen Economy:**  Emerging interest in hydrogen as a clean energy carrier.
