### 1. Introduction: The Central Role of Chemistry in SDGs

Chemistry, at its core, is the study of matter and its properties, as well as how matter changes. This fundamental understanding is *critical* for addressing many of the challenges outlined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The SDGs, adopted in 2015, are a collection of 17 global goals designed to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. Chemistry's role isn't just about 'green chemistry' (although that's important); it's interwoven into nearly every SDG related to resource management, pollution control, energy production, and human health.
