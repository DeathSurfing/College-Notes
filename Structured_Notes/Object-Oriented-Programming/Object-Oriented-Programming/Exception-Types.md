 # Exception Types in Object-Oriented Programming

## Core Definitions

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), exceptions are a powerful mechanism for handling errors and other exceptional conditions. An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. This disruption can be caused by various reasons such as hardware failures, invalid user inputs, or logical errors in the code.

### Types of Exceptions

1. **Checked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. The compiler ensures that these exceptions are either caught with a try-catch block or declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword. Examples include `IOException`, `SQLException`.

2. **Unchecked Exceptions**: Also known as runtime exceptions, these do not need to be declared in the method signature and are not checked at compile-time. They occur during the execution of a program and can be caught or allowed to terminate the program. Examples include `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

3. **Errors**: These are serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Most errors are abnormal conditions, such as `OutOfMemoryError` or `StackOverflowError`.

## Practical Applications

### Handling Exceptions

In practice, exceptions are used to manage error conditions gracefully. For instance, when reading from a file that might not exist, you can use a try-catch block to handle the potential `FileNotFoundException`:

```java
try {
    FileReader reader = new FileReader("file.txt");
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    System.out.println("The file was not found.");
}
```

### Custom Exceptions

Sometimes, the built-in exceptions are not sufficient for a particular application's needs. In such cases, developers can create custom exception classes by extending the `Exception` class:

```java
public class InsufficientFundsException extends Exception {
    public InsufficientFundsException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

### Logging Exceptions

Logging exceptions is crucial for debugging and maintaining applications. Logging libraries like `log4j` or `slf4j` can be used to record exception details:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class Example {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Example.class);

    public void riskyMethod() {
        try {
            // Code that might throw an exception
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error("An error occurred", e);
        }
    }
}
```

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

Exceptions in OOP benefit from the principles of inheritance and polymorphism. For example, a custom exception can inherit from a built-in exception class:

```java
public class DatabaseConnectionException extends SQLException {
    public DatabaseConnectionException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is used to hide the internal state of an object and expose only what is necessary. In the context of exceptions, encapsulation ensures that exceptions are handled in a controlled manner, preventing unintended side effects:

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public void withdraw(double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {
        if (amount > balance) {
            throw new InsufficientFundsException("Insufficient funds for withdrawal.");
        }
        balance -= amount;
    }
}
```

## Simple Examples

### Example 1: Handling File I/O Exception

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileIOExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int data;
            while ((data = reader.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) data);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Custom Exception

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            validateAge(-1); // This will throw an InvalidAgeException
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static void validateAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 0) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age cannot be negative");
        }
    }
}

class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

### Example 3: Logging Exceptions

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class LoggerExample {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggerExample.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            divide(10, 0); // This will throw an ArithmeticException
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            logger.error("Arithmetic error occurred", e);
        }
    }

    public static void divide(int a, int b) {
        int result = a / b;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Understanding exception types and their applications in OOP is crucial for developing robust and maintainable software. By appropriately handling exceptions and leveraging OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, developers can create more resilient and user-friendly applications.
