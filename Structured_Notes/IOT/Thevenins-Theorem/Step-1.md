 # Step 1: Internet of Things (IoT) Context Hierarchy

## Core Definitions

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the network of physical objects—“things”—embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity that enables these objects to collect and exchange data. These devices use the internet to communicate with each other and with human users, creating a vast ecosystem of interconnected devices.

### Key Components:
1. **Sensors**: Collect data from the environment.
2. **Connectivity**: Enables communication between devices (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
3. **Microcontrollers/Processors**: Process the collected data.
4. **Cloud Services**: Store and analyze data collected by IoT devices.
5. **User Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system.

## Practical Applications

### Smart Home
- **Smart Thermostats**: Automatically adjust temperature based on occupancy and time of day.
- **Security Systems**: Use sensors and cameras to monitor and alert homeowners about potential threats.

### Healthcare
- **Wearable Devices**: Track vital signs, sleep patterns, and physical activity.
- **Remote Patient Monitoring**: Allows healthcare providers to monitor patients in real-time.

### Agriculture
- **Smart Irrigation Systems**: Use soil moisture sensors to optimize water usage.
- **Livestock Monitoring**: Track animal health and movement using wearable devices.

### Industrial Automation
- **Predictive Maintenance**: IoT sensors monitor equipment to predict failures before they occur.
- **Inventory Management**: Automatically track inventory levels and reorder supplies as needed.

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
IoT is a subset of CPS, which integrates computation and physical processes. While IoT focuses on the connectivity and data exchange among devices, CPS emphasizes the integration of computation with physical systems.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud services are essential for IoT as they provide storage, processing power, and analytics capabilities. IoT devices often send data to the cloud for analysis and decision-making.

### Big Data Analytics
IoT generates vast amounts of data that need to be processed and analyzed. Big data analytics tools help extract insights from this data, enabling better decision-making and optimization.

## Simple Examples

### Smart Light Bulbs
- **Components**: Sensor (motion), microcontroller, Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **Functionality**: Automatically turn on when motion is detected and off after a period of inactivity.

### Smart Refrigerator
- **Components**: Temperature sensor, camera, microcontroller, Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **Functionality**: Monitor internal temperature, take inventory of contents through the camera, and alert users if the door is left open.

By understanding these core definitions, practical applications, relationships to parent concepts, and simple examples, one can grasp the fundamental aspects of IoT and its significance in various domains.
