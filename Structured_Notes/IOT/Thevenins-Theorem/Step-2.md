 # Step 2: Internet of Things (IoT)

## Core Definitions

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the interconnected network of physical objects, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data. IoT devices are typically connected via the internet or other communication networks, allowing them to interact with each other and with users.

### Key Components of IoT:
1. **Sensors**: Collect data from the environment.
2. **Connectivity**: Transmits data using various protocols (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee).
3. **Data Processing**: Analyzes and processes the collected data.
4. **User Interface**: Allows users to interact with IoT devices.
5. **Actuators**: Perform actions based on the processed data.

## Practical Applications

### Smart Home
- **Smart Thermostats**: Control home temperature remotely.
- **Smart Lights**: Automate lighting based on occupancy or time of day.
- **Security Systems**: Monitor and control security cameras, locks, and alarms.

### Industrial IoT (IIoT)
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Use sensors to monitor equipment health and predict failures.
- **Supply Chain Management**: Track inventory and shipments in real time.
- **Energy Management**: Optimize energy consumption and reduce costs.

### Healthcare
- **Remote Patient Monitoring**: Track vital signs and other health metrics.
- **Medication Management**: Automate the dispensing of medications.
- **Wearable Devices**: Collect data on physical activity, sleep patterns, etc.

### Agriculture
- **Smart Irrigation**: Automatically adjust water usage based on soil moisture levels.
- **Crop Monitoring**: Use sensors to monitor crop health and environmental conditions.
- **Livestock Tracking**: Monitor animal movement and health.
