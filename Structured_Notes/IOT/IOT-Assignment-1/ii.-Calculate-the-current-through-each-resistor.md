 ## II. Calculate the Current Through Each Resistor in IoT Circuits

### Core Definitions

In the context of Internet of Things (IoT) circuits, calculating the current through each resistor is crucial for ensuring proper functionality and optimizing power consumption. Here are some key definitions:

- **Current (I):** The flow of electric charge per unit time, measured in Amperes (A).
- **Resistor:** A passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
- **Ohm's Law:** The fundamental law stating that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Mathematically, \( V = IR \), where \( V \) is the voltage, \( I \) is the current, and \( R \) is the resistance.
- **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):** The sum of currents entering a node (or junction) must equal the sum of currents leaving that node. Mathematically, \( \sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out} \).

### Practical Applications in IoT

1. **Power Optimization:** Calculating current helps in optimizing power consumption, which is critical for battery-operated IoT devices to extend their lifespan.
2. **Safety and Reliability:** Ensuring that the current through each resistor stays within safe limits prevents overheating and potential failures of components.
3. **Design Verification:** Accurate current calculations help verify circuit designs, ensuring they meet performance requirements before deployment.
4. **Troubleshooting:** In cases where IoT devices malfunction, calculating the current can help identify issues such as short circuits or open paths.

### Relationships to Parent Concepts

- **Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff’s Laws:** The calculation of current through resistors is directly related to these fundamental laws of electrical engineering.
- **Circuit Topology:** The arrangement of resistors in series, parallel, or more complex configurations affects the distribution of current.
- **Power Consumption:** The power dissipated by a resistor is given by \( P = I^2R \). Efficient power management is essential for IoT devices with limited energy resources.

### Simple Examples

#### Example 1: Series Circuit

Consider a simple circuit with three resistors (\( R_1, R_2, R_3 \)) connected in series to a voltage source \( V \).

- **Total Resistance:** \( R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 \)
- **Total Current:** Using Ohm's Law, \( I_{total} = \frac{V}{R_{total}} \)

Since the current is the same through each resistor in a series circuit:
\[ I_1 = I_2 = I_3 = I_{total} \]

#### Example 2: Parallel Circuit

Now, consider three resistors (\( R_1, R_2, R_3 \)) connected in parallel to the same voltage source \( V \).

- **Equivalent Resistance:** Using the formula for parallel resistances, \( \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} \)
- **Total Current:** \( I_{total} = \frac{V}{R_{eq}} \)

The current through each resistor is given by:
\[ I_1 = \frac{V}{R_1}, \quad I_2 = \frac{V}{R_2}, \quad I_3 = \frac{V}{R_3} \]

And according to Kirchhoff's Current Law:
\[ I_{total} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 \]

### Conclusion

Calculating the current through each resistor in IoT circuits is essential for designing efficient, reliable, and safe systems. By applying Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff's laws, engineers can ensure optimal power consumption and prevent component failures, thereby extending the lifespan of IoT devices.
