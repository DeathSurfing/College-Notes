## Core Definitions

### Software Design
Software design refers to the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system before it is implemented. It involves creating models that represent the structure of a software system, including its classes, methods, and data structures. Effective software design ensures that the system is maintainable, scalable, and efficient.

### System Design
System design encompasses the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves creating models that represent the structure of a system, including its hardware, software, and human resources. Effective system design ensures that the system is reliable, efficient, and meets the needs of its users.

## Practical Applications

### Software Design
- **Object-Oriented Design (OOD):** Used in applications where the system can be modeled as a collection of objects with attributes and methods. OOD helps in creating reusable code and maintaining clean interfaces between components.
- **Design Patterns:** Predefined templates for solving common problems in software design. Examples include Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns.
- **User Interface Design:** Focuses on creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that enhance the user experience.

### System Design
- **Microservices Architecture:** Used to build scalable and maintainable systems by breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, independent services.
- **Distributed Systems:** Applied in scenarios where data and functionality are spread across multiple computers or devices that communicate over a network.
- **Database Design:** Involves creating schemas and tables to store and manage data efficiently within a system.

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### Software Design
- **Parent Concept: Software Engineering**
  - Software design is a key aspect of the broader field of software engineering, which includes activities like requirements gathering, coding, testing, and maintenance. Effective software design ensures that the subsequent phases are more efficient and effective.

### System Design
- **Parent Concept: Systems Engineering**
  - System design is integral to systems engineering, which encompasses the complete system development lifecycle including concept exploration, design synthesis, and verification. Effective system design helps in ensuring that the system meets its intended purpose and performance requirements.

## Simple Examples

### Software Design Example
Consider designing a simple library management system:
- **Classes:** `Book`, `Member`, `Loan`
  - `Book` has attributes like `title`, `author`, `ISBN`.
  - `Member` has attributes like `name`, `membership_id`.
  - `Loan` connects `Book` and `Member` with additional attributes like `loan_date`, `return_date`.
- **Methods:** `checkout`, `returnBook`, `findBookByTitle`.

### System Design Example
Consider designing a simple e-commerce system:
- **Components:** User Interface (UI), Backend Server, Database, Payment Gateway.
  - **UI:** Handles user interactions and displays products.
  - **Backend Server:** Manages business logic and processes requests from the UI.
  - **Database:** Stores product information, user data, and order details.
  - **Payment Gateway:** Processes transactions securely.
- **Interfaces:** REST APIs between UI and Backend Server, Database queries for product information.
