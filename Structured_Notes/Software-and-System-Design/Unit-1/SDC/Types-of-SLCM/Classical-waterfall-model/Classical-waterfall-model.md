 # Classical Waterfall Model

## Core Definitions

The Classical Waterfall Model is a sequential software development process, often depicted as a series of linear steps. Each phase must be completed before proceeding to the next one. This model is based on the idea that each stage of the project has its own distinct goal and deliverable. The primary stages in the waterfall model include:

1. **Requirements Specification**: Gathering and documenting all the requirements for the system.
2. **System Design**: Defining the system architecture, including hardware and software components.
3. **Implementation or Coding**: Writing the code based on the design specifications.
4. **Testing**: Verifying that the system meets the specified requirements.
5. **Deployment**: Releasing the system into the market or to the end-users.
6. **Maintenance**: Addressing any issues or bugs that arise post-deployment.

## Practical Applications

The Classical Waterfall Model is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and where changes are unlikely. It can be applied in various contexts, such as:

- **Large-scale projects** where detailed planning and documentation are critical.
- **Regulated industries** like healthcare or finance, where compliance and traceability are essential.
- **Legacy systems** that require updates but have stable requirements.

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### Software-and-System Design
The Classical Waterfall Model is a fundamental approach within the broader field of software and system design. It emphasizes thorough planning and documentation, which are essential for creating reliable systems.

### Unit-1 (Software Development Cycle)
Within the context of the Software Development Cycle (SDC), the waterfall model represents one of the earliest and most straightforward approaches to managing the development process. Other models, like Agile or Iterative, have evolved from this foundation to address some of its limitations.

### Types-of-SLCM (Software Life Cycle Models)
The Classical Waterfall Model is a type of Software Life Cycle Model that emphasizes sequential development phases. It contrasts with other SLCM types like Agile, which allow for more flexibility and iteration during the development process.

## Simple Examples

### Example 1: Development of a Banking System

1. **Requirements Specification**: Gather all requirements from stakeholders, including security features, user authentication, transaction processing, etc.
2. **System Design**: Define the architecture, choosing appropriate databases and ensuring compliance with banking regulations.
3. **Implementation or Coding**: Develop the system using secure coding practices.
4. **Testing**: Conduct rigorous testing to ensure all transactions are processed accurately and securely.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the system to bank branches and online platforms.
6. **Maintenance**: Monitor the system for any bugs or security breaches, applying patches as needed.

### Example 2: Development of a Simple Website

1. **Requirements Specification**: Determine the website's purpose, features (e.g., contact form, blog), and target audience.
2. **System Design**: Plan the layout, choose the technology stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
3. **Implementation or Coding**: Write the code for each page and feature.
4. **Testing**: Test all links, forms, and functionalities to ensure they work correctly across different browsers.
5. **Deployment**: Upload the website to a server.
6. **Maintenance**: Regularly update content and fix any broken links or errors.

In both examples, each phase must be completed before moving on to the next, ensuring a systematic approach to development.
