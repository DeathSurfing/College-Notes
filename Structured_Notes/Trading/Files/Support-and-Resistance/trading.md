## Core Definitions

Trading is a broad term that encompasses various activities involving the exchange of goods, services, or financial instruments. In the context of finance and economics, trading typically refers to the buying and selling of assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and derivatives on financial markets. The primary goal of trading is to generate profits by taking advantage of price movements in these assets.

### Key Concepts

- **Market**: A platform where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods or services. Financial markets include stock exchanges, commodity markets, and foreign exchange markets.
- **Assets**: Items of economic value that can be bought or sold. In trading, assets commonly include stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities.
- **Price Movement**: The change in the price of an asset over time. Traders aim to profit from these movements by buying low and selling high.
- **Profit and Loss (P&L)**: Financial outcomes resulting from trading activities. Profit is realized when the sale price exceeds the purchase price, while loss occurs when the opposite is true.

## Practical Applications

Trading has numerous practical applications across different sectors of the economy:

### Stock Trading

- **Day Trading**: A strategy where traders open and close multiple positions within a single trading day to profit from small price movements.
- **Swing Trading**: Involves holding positions overnight or for several days, aiming to capture larger price swings.

### Forex Trading

- **Currency Pairs**: Traders buy one currency while selling another, speculating on changes in exchange rates.
- **Leverage**: Allows traders to control a large position with a small amount of capital, amplifying potential profits and losses.
