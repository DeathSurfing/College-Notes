## Core Definitions

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It introduces several core definitions that are crucial for understanding its principles:

- **Wave-Particle Duality**: This principle states that every particle or quantum entity can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. For example, electrons can behave like waves under certain conditions.

- **Superposition**: A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. The famous thought experiment, Schr√∂dinger's cat, illustrates this concept where a cat in a box can be both alive and dead at the same time until observed.

- **Quantum Entanglement**: When two or more particles become entangled, the state of one particle instantly affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon is often referred to as "spooky action at a distance" by Einstein.

- **Quantization**: Certain properties, such as energy and angular momentum, can only take on specific, discrete values rather than any value. This is known as quantization.

## Practical Applications

Quantum physics has led to numerous practical applications that have transformed various fields of science and technology:

- **Semiconductor Technology**: The development of transistors and integrated circuits relies heavily on the principles of quantum mechanics, enabling modern electronics such as computers, smartphones, and other digital devices.

- **Laser Technology**: Lasers operate based on the principle of stimulated emission, a process where photons induce other atoms to emit more photons, resulting in amplified light. Lasers are used in various applications including surgery, manufacturing, and telecommunications.

- **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: MRI machines use the principles of quantum mechanics to create detailed images of the body's internal structures without exposing the patient to radiation.

- **Cryptography**: Quantum cryptography utilizes the principles of quantum entanglement and superposition to develop highly secure communication methods, making it virtually impossible for eavesdroppers to intercept information.

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

Quantum physics is a branch of physics that emerged in the early 20th century as an extension and refinement of classical physics. It addresses phenomena that classical physics could not explain adequately:

- **Classical Mechanics**: Quantum mechanics differs from classical mechanics, which deals with the motion of macroscopic objects. Quantum mechanics introduces probabilistic descriptions and wave-particle duality to account for the behavior of particles at the quantum scale.

- **Electromagnetism**: The principles of electromagnetism are crucial in understanding quantum phenomena, particularly in the context of light (photons) and their interactions with matter. Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory that describes how light and matter interact.

- **Thermodynamics**: Quantum mechanics provides a more detailed explanation for thermodynamic properties such as heat capacity, entropy, and the behavior of gases at low temperatures.

## Simple Examples

### Double-Slit Experiment

The double-slit experiment is a foundational demonstration of wave-particle duality:

1. When light or electrons pass through two closely spaced slits, they create an interference pattern on a screen behind the slits.
2. This pattern is characteristic of waves and cannot be explained by classical particle theory alone.
3. The experiment shows that particles like electrons can exhibit wave-like properties, confirming the principles of quantum mechanics.

### Quantum Entanglement

Consider two entangled photons:

1. When one photon is measured to have a specific polarization (e.g., vertical), the other photon will instantaneously be measured with the opposite polarization (e.g., horizontal).
2. This instant correlation occurs regardless of the distance between the photons, demonstrating the non-local nature of quantum entanglement.

### Superposition in a Quantum Bit (Qubit)

A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information:

1. Unlike classical bits that can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.
2. When measured, the qubit collapses to either 0 or 1 with probabilities determined by its state before measurement.
3. This property is fundamental for quantum computing and cryptography.

By understanding these core definitions, practical applications, relationships to parent concepts, and simple examples, one can gain a comprehensive overview of quantum physics and its significance in modern science and technology.
