# Significance of De Broglie's hypothesis:

## Context Path
Physics

## Content
- **Wave-particle duality**: It shows that particles have wave-like characteristics, and these waves can be observed under specific conditions, particularly for small particles like electrons.
- **Electron diffraction**: The concept was crucial in explaining phenomena such as electron diffraction, where electrons, behaving like waves, can produce interference patterns.
- **Quantum mechanics**: The de Broglie wavelength played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics, particularly in the understanding of the behavior of electrons in atoms.

Given:
- Mass of electron, $m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}$
- Speed of electron, $v = 1 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}$
- Planck's constant, $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$

Momentum of electron:
$p = mv = (9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}) \times (1 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}) = 9.11 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}$

de Broglie wavelength:
$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{9.11 \times 10^{-25}} = 7.28 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \, (0.728 \, \text{nm})$

# Q7) Define Wave function. Explain Physical Significance of the wave function. Also, list out the properties of wave function.

A wave function refers to a mathematical description of a particle's quantum state as a function of spin, time, momentum, and position.
Wave functions are denoted by the letter $\psi$ 

Wave functions are a complex function $\psi=A+Bi$
