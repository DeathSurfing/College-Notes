## Core Definitions

Planck's constant, denoted by \( h \), is a fundamental physical constant that plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics. It was first introduced by Max Planck in 1900 as part of his solution to the black-body radiation problem. The value of Planck's constant is approximately:
\[ h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Joule seconds} \]
or, in its angular frequency form (\( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \)):
\[ \hbar \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Joule seconds} \]

## Practical Applications

### Quantum Mechanics
Planck's constant is essential in the formulation of quantum mechanics, especially in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle:
\[ \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \]
This principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously measure the exact position and momentum of a particle.

### Photoelectric Effect
In the photoelectric effect, Planck's constant helps explain why electrons are ejected from a metal surface when exposed to light of sufficient frequency. The energy of a photon (\( E \)) is given by:
\[ E = h\nu \]
where \( \nu \) (nu) is the frequency of the light.

### Wave-Particle Duality
Planck's constant also appears in the de Broglie wavelength equation, which describes the wave nature of particles:
\[ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \]
where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( p \) is the momentum.

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### Quantum Theory
Planck's constant is a cornerstone of quantum theory, which emerged as an explanation for phenomena that classical physics could not account for, such as black-body radiation and the photoelectric effect.

### Classical Physics
In contrast to classical physics, where properties like energy and momentum can take any value, Planck's constant introduces quantization in quantum mechanics. This means certain properties can only have discrete values.

## Simple Examples

### Black-Body Radiation
Max Planck used his constant to derive the black-body radiation law, which describes the spectral distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body at a given temperature. The formula is:
\[ B_\nu(T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2} \cdot \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_BT} - 1} \]
where \( B_\nu(T) \) is the spectral radiance, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant.

### Photoelectric Effect Experiment
A simple experiment to demonstrate the photoelectric effect involves a metal plate (cathode) and a collector (anode). When light of sufficient frequency shines on the cathode, electrons are emitted and can be collected by the anode. This demonstrates the particle nature of light and the role of Planck's constant in determining the energy of photons.

### De Broglie Wavelength Calculation
For a simple calculation, consider an electron moving with a velocity \( v \). The de Broglie wavelength can be calculated as:
\[ \lambda = \frac{h}{mv} \]
where \( m \) is the mass of the electron. This equation shows how Planck's constant relates the momentum and wavelength of particles, illustrating their wave-particle duality.
