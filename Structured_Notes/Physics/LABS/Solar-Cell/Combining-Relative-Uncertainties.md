 # Combining Relative Uncertainties in Physics Labs

## Core Definitions

### Relative Uncertainty
Relative uncertainty is a measure of the precision of a measurement. It is expressed as the ratio of the absolute uncertainty to the measured value and often represented as a percentage. The formula for relative uncertainty (\( \delta \)) is:

\[ \delta = \frac{\Delta x}{x} \]

where \( \Delta x \) is the absolute uncertainty, and \( x \) is the measured value.

### Combining Uncertainties
When performing calculations in physics labs that involve multiple measurements, it is essential to combine their uncertainties correctly. There are different methods for combining uncertainties depending on how the measurements are related:

1. **Addition and Subtraction**: When adding or subtracting two quantities with uncertainties, the combined uncertainty is found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties.
   \[ \Delta (x_1 + x_2) = \sqrt{(\Delta x_1)^2 + (\Delta x_2)^2} \]

2. **Multiplication and Division**: When multiplying or dividing two quantities with uncertainties, the combined uncertainty is found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the relative uncertainties.
   \[ \delta (x_1 x_2) = \sqrt{(\delta x_1)^2 + (\delta x_2)^2} \]

## Practical Applications

### Measurement in Labs
In a physics lab, combining relative uncertainties is crucial for accurately reporting experimental results. For example:
- **Determining the Density of an Object**: If you measure the mass \( m \) and volume \( V \) of an object to find its density \( \rho = \frac{m}{V} \), you would combine their uncertainties as follows:
  \[ \delta \rho = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta m}{m}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\Delta V}{V}\right)^2} \]

### Data Analysis
Combining relative uncertainties is also important in data analysis. For instance, when calculating the average of multiple measurements:
- **Average Calculation**: If you have \( n \) measurements with uncertainties \( \Delta x_i \), the combined uncertainty for the average \( \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \) is:
  \[ \Delta \bar{x} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (\Delta x_i)^2} \]

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### Absolute and Relative Uncertainty
Relative uncertainty is derived from absolute uncertainty. While absolute uncertainty provides the precision of a measurement in its own unit, relative uncertainty offers a more universal comparison by expressing uncertainty as a fraction or percentage of the measured value.

### Propagation of Error
Combining uncertainties in calculations follows the principles of error propagation. This ensures that the overall uncertainty reflects the accumulated errors from each step in the calculation process, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of experimental results.

## Simple Examples

### Example 1: Measuring Lengths
Suppose you measure two lengths, \( L_1 = 50 \pm 2 \) cm and \( L_2 = 30 \pm 1 \) cm. To find the combined uncertainty for their sum \( L_{total} = L_1 + L_2 \):
\[ \Delta L_{total} = \sqrt{(2)^2 + (1)^2} = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.24 \, \text{cm} \]
Thus, the total length with uncertainty is:
\[ L_{total} = 80 \pm 2.24 \, \text{cm} \]

### Example 2: Calculating Density
You measure the mass \( m = 100 \pm 5 \) g and volume \( V = 20 \pm 1 \) cmÂ³ of an object to find its density \( \rho \):
\[ \delta m = \frac{5}{100} = 0.05 \]
\[ \delta V = \frac{1}{20} = 0.05 \]
\[ \delta \rho = \sqrt{(0.05)^2 + (0.05)^2} = \sqrt{0.005} \approx 0.0707 \]
Thus, the density with uncertainty is:
\[ \rho = 5 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \pm 0.36 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \]

By understanding and correctly applying these principles, you can ensure that your experimental results in physics labs are both accurate and reliable.
