 # Group Theory

Group theory is a branch of abstract algebra that studies the algebraic structures known as groups. Groups are ubiquitous in mathematics and have numerous applications across various fields, including physics, chemistry, computer science, and cryptography.

## Core Definitions

### Group
A group \( (G, \cdot) \) is a set \( G \) equipped with an operation \( \cdot \), called the group operation or multiplication, that satisfies the following conditions:
1. **Closure**: For all \( a, b \in G \), the element \( a \cdot b \) is also in \( G \).
2. **Associativity**: For all \( a, b, c \in G \), \( (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \).
3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element \( e \in G \) such that for every \( a \in G \), \( e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a \).
4. **Inverse Element**: For each \( a \in G \), there exists an element \( b \in G \) such that \( a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e \).

### Subgroup
A subset \( H \subseteq G \) is called a subgroup of \( G \) if \( H \) itself is a group under the operation inherited from \( G \).

### Normal Subgroup
A subgroup \( N \) of \( G \) is normal (or invariant) if for every \( g \in G \) and \( n \in N \), the element \( g^{-1}ng \) is also in \( N \).

### Homomorphism
A homomorphism between two groups \( (G, \cdot) \) and \( (H, *) \) is a function \( f: G \to H \) such that for all \( a, b \in G \), \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) * f(b) \).

### Isomorphism
Two groups \( (G, \cdot) \) and \( (H, *) \) are isomorphic if there exists a bijective homomorphism \( f: G \to H \).

## Practical Applications

### Physics
- **Symmetry Groups**: In physics, symmetry groups describe the symmetries of physical systems. Examples include the Lorentz group in special relativity and the Poincar√© group in quantum field theory.
- **Representation Theory**: Group representations are used to study the properties of particles and fields in quantum mechanics.

### Chemistry
- **Molecular Symmetry**: Groups describe the symmetry of molecules, helping to predict their physical and chemical properties.

### Cryptography
- **Cryptographic Protocols**: Groups underlie many cryptographic protocols, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange and elliptic curve cryptography.

### Computer Science
- **Error-Correcting Codes**: Group theory is used to design error-correcting codes that can detect and correct errors in data transmission.

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

### Abstract Algebra
Group theory is a fundamental branch of abstract algebra, which also includes ring theory, field theory, and module theory.

### Linear Algebra
Groups are closely related to linear algebra, particularly through the concept of group representations, where groups act on vector spaces.

## Simple Examples

### Cyclic Group
The set \( \mathbb{Z}_n = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\} \) with addition modulo \( n \) forms a cyclic group under addition. For example, \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) is a cyclic group of order 5.

### Symmetric Group
The symmetric group \( S_3 \) consists of all permutations of the set \( \{1, 2, 3\} \). It has six elements and can be represented as:
\[
S_3 = \{ (1), (12), (13), (23), (123), (132) \}
\]
where each permutation is written in cycle notation.

### Dihedral Group
The dihedral group \( D_4 \) of order 8 consists of the symmetries of a square, including rotations and reflections. It can be represented as:
\[
D_4 = \{ (1), (1234), (13), (24), (12), (34), (1432), (23) \}
\]

By understanding these core definitions, practical applications, relationships to parent concepts, and simple examples, one can gain a solid foundation in group theory.
