## Core Definitions

Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving approach that involves expressing problems and their solutions in ways that computers can execute. This methodology encompasses several key principles:

1. **Decomposition**: Breaking down complex problems into simpler, more manageable parts.
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying similarities or regularities within the problem.
3. **Abstraction**: Focusing on the essential features while ignoring irrelevant details.
4. **Algorithm Design**: Developing a step-by-step procedure to solve the problem.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the solution.

These principles are not exclusive to computer science but can be applied across various disciplines to enhance problem-solving capabilities.

## Practical Applications

### Education

Incorporating computational thinking into educational curricula helps students develop critical thinking skills, logical reasoning, and problem-solving abilities. This approach is not limited to computer science but can be integrated into subjects like mathematics, science, and even humanities.

### Business and Industry

Businesses use CT to optimize processes, improve decision-making, and enhance efficiency. For example:

- **Logistics**: Decomposing complex supply chain problems into smaller tasks and using algorithms to optimize routes.
- **Market Analysis**: Identifying patterns in consumer behavior to develop targeted marketing strategies.

### Healthcare

In healthcare, CT is employed to analyze large datasets for disease diagnosis, personalized treatment plans, and predicting patient outcomes. For instance:

- **Genomics**: Using pattern recognition to identify genetic mutations associated with diseases.
- **Epidemiology**: Applying algorithms to model the spread of infectious diseases.

### Everyday Life

CT is also present in everyday activities, such as planning a trip (decomposition and algorithm design) or organizing finances (pattern recognition and abstraction).

## Relationships to Parent Concepts

Computational thinking is closely related to several foundational concepts:

### Problem-Solving

CT is an extension of traditional problem-solving methods, incorporating principles that are particularly useful in the digital age. While general problem-solving techniques focus on finding solutions, CT emphasizes the execution and automation of those solutions.

### Computer Science

As a core discipline within computer science, CT underpins various fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and software engineering. It provides a framework for designing algorithms and systems that can be executed by computers.

### Cognitive Science

CT shares many principles with cognitive science, which studies the mental processes underlying thought and behavior. Both fields explore how humans process information, solve problems, and make decisions.

## Simple Examples

### Planning a Route

1. **Decomposition**: Break down the journey into smaller segments (e.g., home to work).
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common routes or traffic patterns.
3. **Abstraction**: Focus on essential landmarks and ignore irrelevant details.
4. **Algorithm Design**: Develop a step-by-step plan for each segment of the journey.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess the route for efficiency (e.g., shortest time).

### Organizing Files

1. **Decomposition**: Categorize files into folders based on type or date.
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Group similar file types together (e.g., all documents in one folder).
3. **Abstraction**: Use descriptive names for folders to ignore unnecessary details.
4. **Algorithm Design**: Create a system for naming and storing files.
5. **Evaluation**: Ensure the organization is efficient and easy to navigate.

By applying computational thinking in these examples, one can enhance problem-solving skills and achieve more effective and efficient outcomes.
