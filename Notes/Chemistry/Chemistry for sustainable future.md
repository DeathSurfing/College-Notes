# Weather and Climate

## Weather
- Short term changes in temperature and living conditions of an area

## Climate:
- Long term shift in temperature and weather patterns due to human activity and other reasons due to climate change.

# Impact of climate change on environment

-  Increased average temperatures
- Melting Ice caps and glaciers
- Sea level rise
- Ocean acidification
	- $CO_2+H_2O \rightarrow H_2CO_3$ 
	- $H_2CO_3 \rightarrow H^+ + HCO_3^-$ 
- Extreme events
	- Storms
	- Droughts
	- Floods
	- Wildfires
- Bio diversity loss
- Shifts in ecosystems and migration patterns
- Disruption of freshwater systems
- impact on agriculture and food security
- Forest degradation and wildfires

# Why does the climate change?

## Global warming
- The phenomena of gradual increase in temperature of earth of atmosphere by anthropogenic green house effect.
- Natural green house effect helps main the earths temperature
- Anthropogenic green house effect leads to excess trapped heat, which causes global warming and contributes to climate change.
