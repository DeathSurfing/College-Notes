## Types of Electrical Supply


- DC:  Direct current![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 2.24.42 PM.png]]
- AC: Alternative Current![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 2.25.09 PM.png]]



## Resistance:
- Opposes the flow of current 
- Unit: Ohms 
	- $$\Omega$$
- The representation of resistance is either (R or r)
- The Graphical representation of resistance is
