# Unit 1 :
## Prior knowledge:

### Set forms:
- Roster A= { 1,a,2,b,... } 
- Builder $$x/ 0\leq x\leq1,x\in\mathbb{R}$$
- Vendiagram


### Cardinality:
The cardinal number of a set is defined as the number of elements in a finite set.
#### Represented by:
$$Card(A)\ or\ n(A) \ or\ (A)$$
### Empty set:
Empty set or null set is represented by $$ \phi $$
### Property of sets:
- Repetitions are not allowed . {1,1,1,1,1} is not allowed
- In a set order doesn't matter . {1 ,2} or {2,1} are the same


### Books recommended for Discrete Math course:
- Discrete mathematics by K.H Rosen
- Schum outlines  

### Mathematical symbols:
$$\exists=There \ Exists$$
$$\in=Belongs\ to$$
$$\backepsilon=Such \ That$$
$$\forall=For\ all$$
### Mathematical representation of Subsets
When can we say $$A\subseteq B$$
When
$$\forall x\in A\implies x\in B$$
Then
$$A\subseteq B$$
### Proper Subset : $$A\subset B$$
When all the elements are properly contained within B


### When are two sets equal?

$$A\subset B\ and \ b\subset A$$
$$A=B$$
