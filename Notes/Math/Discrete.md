- Reflexive
- Anti Symmetric
- Transitive
properties

### Comparable and incomparable POSET

#### Comparable POSET:
Two elements a and b in a POSET $(S, \leq)$ is comparable if it satisfies one of the following conditions:
$S= \{a,b\}$
$a\leq b\ \vee b\leq a$
$a\subseteq  b\ \vee b\subseteq a$
$a/b \vee b/a$


#### Incomparable POSET:
Two elements a and b in a POSET$(S,\leq)$ is incomparable if it doesn't satisfy any of the conditions of comparable
