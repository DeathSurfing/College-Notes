### Solved Problems

#### 1.1 
Which of these sets are equal: \( \{x, y, z\}, \{z, y, x\}, \{y, z, x\}, \{z, y, z\}, \{y, z, y\} \)?

They are equal because order and repetition do not change a set.

#### 1.2 
List the elements of each set where \(N = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}\):

(a) $$ A = \{ x \in N \mid 3 \leq x \leq 9 \}$$
(b) $$ B = \{ x \in N \mid x \text{ is even} \land x < 11 \} $$
(c) $$C = \{ x \in N \mid 4n + x = 3 \}$$

**Ans:**

(a) A consists of the positive integers between 3 and 9; hence \( A = \{ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \} \).

(b) B consists of the even positive integers less than 11; hence \( B = \{ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 \} \).

(c) No positive integer satisfies \( 4n + x = 3 \); hence \( C = \emptyset \), the empty set.

#### 1.3 
Let $$A = \{ 2, 3, 4, 5 \} $$:

(a) Show that \( A \) is not a subset of
$$B = \{ x \in N \mid x \text{ is even} \} $$.

(b) Show that \( A \) is a proper subset of 
$$ C = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \} $$.

**Ans:**

(a) It is necessary to show that at least one element in \( A \) does not belong to \( B \).
Now \
$$3 \in A $$
, and since \( B \) consists of even numbers,
$$ 3 \notin B $$;hence \( A \) is not a subset of \( B \).

(b) $$ A \subseteq C $$, but since \( C \) has elements not in \( A \), such as \( 1 \) and \( 9 \), \( A \) is a proper subset of \( C \).
