---

### **Scene Opens**

_Aditya and Raghav step onto the Shark Tank stage, standing confidently in front of the Sharks._

---

### **Aditya (Entrepreneur â€“ 1 min)**

_"Hello Sharks! Iâ€™m Aditya."_

_"And Iâ€™m Raghav."_

_"And we are here to revolutionize the way students work and earn on campus withâ€¦ WoxMart!"_

_"Imagine thisâ€”you're a student, stuck in the library cramming for an exam, but youâ€™re starving. What if you could pay another student to pick up food for you? Or maybe youâ€™re heading to the canteen anywayâ€”wouldnâ€™t it be great to make some extra cash by delivering food along the way?"_

_"WoxMart is a Web3-powered gig economy platform built on the Solana blockchain. It allows students to earn WoxCoinsâ€”our crypto tokenâ€”by completing small tasks like food delivery, document printing, or running errands for their peers. These WoxCoins can be spent within the university ecosystem or even traded for real money!"_

_"We are seeking â‚¹50 lakh for 10% equity to scale this across universities and make student gigs the future of campus work."_

---

### **Raghav (Entrepreneur â€“ 1 min)**

_"Sharks, universities are full of students who need extra cash but donâ€™t have time for full-time jobs. On the other side, students have daily needsâ€”food runs, errand pickups, library book returns. WoxMart connects the two and monetizes everyday student life."_

_"What makes us different? WoxMart is built on the **Solana blockchain**, meaning transactions are fast, secure, and decentralized, with minimal fees."_

_"We launched a pilot with 200 students, and in just one month, over 500 transactions were completed, proving that students **want** this service."_

_"Now, Sharks, letâ€™s talk business! Who wants to be part of the **Web3 revolution for student jobs**?"_

---

### **Investors React**

_The Sharks nod, intrigued. Melvin leans forward._

---

### **Melvin (Investor â€“ 2 mins)**

_"Aditya, Raghavâ€”this is an interesting idea. The gig economy is booming, and crypto integration is exciting. But I have concerns. Blockchain adoption is still low in traditional settings. How will you ensure that students, many of whom have never used crypto, will actually use WoxCoin?"_

_"Also, how do you prevent price volatility? If students earn WoxCoin today and tomorrow the value crashes, they might lose trust in the platform."_

---

### **Aditya (Entrepreneur â€“ 1 min)**

_"Great question, Melvin! We tackle adoption with a **user-friendly mobile app** that abstracts the complexity of blockchain. Think of WoxMart like a **Venmo for student gigs**â€”students send and receive WoxCoins as easily as using a payment app. Plus, we offer **one-click cash-out** to INR, so theyâ€™re not forced to hold crypto."_

_"For stability, we use a hybrid systemâ€”**a portion of WoxCoins is backed by stable assets**. This keeps the price steady while still allowing growth in value."_

---

### **Suhas (Investor â€“ 2 mins)**

_"I like the concept, but letâ€™s talk scale. Your pilot had 200 students, but what happens when you try to onboard 10,000 students? Have you thought about transaction speeds, blockchain congestion, and legal compliance?"_

---

### **Raghav (Entrepreneur â€“ 1 min)**

_"Absolutely, Suhas! Thatâ€™s why we chose **Solana**â€”it handles **65,000 transactions per second**, making it perfect for microtransactions like ours."_

_"As for legal compliance, we are working on integrating **RBI-approved crypto regulations** and ensuring full KYC verification for withdrawals. Plus, we have partnerships in the pipeline with university management to integrate WoxMart as an **official campus service**."_

---

### **Shrika (Investor â€“ 2 mins)**

_"Okay, I see potential, but my concern is **user retention**. If students only use WoxMart for side income, what stops them from dropping off after a while? Whatâ€™s your long-term monetization plan?"_

---

### **Aditya (Entrepreneur â€“ 1 min)**

_"Great point, Shrika! We keep students engaged through **loyalty rewards**â€”the more they use WoxMart, the more bonuses they unlock. Think of it like a **frequent flyer program for student gigs**. Plus, universities benefit by automating small jobs like event staffing and note-sharing, keeping engagement high."_

_"And our revenue? We take a **5% fee on every transaction**. Based on our pilot, we project **â‚¹10 crores in transactions** within two years, meaning â‚¹50 lakhs in revenue annually!"_

---

### **Investors Whisper Among Themselves**

_Suhas, Melvin, and Shrika discuss potential offers. Thenâ€¦_

---

### **Melvinâ€™s Offer**

_"Alright, guys, I like it. Iâ€™ll offer you â‚¹50 lakh, but for **20% equity**. You need me to help navigate crypto regulations."_

---

### **Suhasâ€™ Offer**

_"Iâ€™m in too, but Iâ€™ll offer â‚¹50 lakh for **15% equity**, because I think you can scale faster than you realize."_

---

### **Shrikaâ€™s Offer**

_"I love the energy, and I think you need a strong marketing push. Iâ€™ll give you â‚¹50 lakh for **12% equity**, but I want **5% in advisory shares** to guide branding and partnerships."_

---

### **Aditya & Raghav (Entrepreneurs â€“ Final Decision)**

_Aditya and Raghav huddle, whispering, then turn back to the Sharks._

_"We appreciate all your offers. **Shrika, weâ€™ll take your deal!** We believe your marketing expertise will help us dominate the campus economy!"_

---

### **Closing Scene**

_Handshakes all around. The Sharks applaud as Aditya and Raghav leave the stage, celebrating their investment in WoxMart!_ ðŸŽ‰
