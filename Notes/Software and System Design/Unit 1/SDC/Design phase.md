## Design phase:
- ### High level
	- Module Structure
	- Control relationships among the modules
	- Call relationship or invocation relationship
	- Interface among different modules
		- Defined as the data item exchanged among modules
- ### Low level
	- Data structures of individual modules
	- Algorithms for individual modules
