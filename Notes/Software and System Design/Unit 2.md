## OOA (Object Oriented Analysis)



## OOD (Object Oriented Design)




## OOP(Object-Oriented Programming)
- Programming paradigm based upon objects (having both data and methods) 
- Objects are usually instances of classes are used to interact with one and another to design applications and computer programs.

## Class
- Template for object creation
- Considered as abstract data type (ADT)
- Can be thought of as the blueprint for the object

## Objects
- Instances of class
- Real world entities that have an existence
- Consists of 
	- Attributes
	- Methods
- Has:
	- Identity
	- State
	- Behaviour

# Encapsulation and Data hiding

## Encapsulation:
- The process of binding both attributes and methods together with a class
- Hides internal details of a a class
- Allows the class to be accessed from outside only

## Data Hiding:
- Classes should be designed such that attributes can be access by its class methods 
- The process of insulating an objects data is called data hiding

# Interfaces:
- Methods of a different class that allow interaction between different classes or applications


# Inheritance:
- Taking attributes or methods from existing classes

# Message Passing:

# Polymorphism
- Ability to take multiple forms
- Ability for multiple forms in which methods can exists .
