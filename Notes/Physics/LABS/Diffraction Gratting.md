# Theory:
Diffraction is the term used to describe how waves expand out after going through a tiny aperture. When the opening's size is equal to or less than the wavelength, diffraction effects become significant. We need a tool that can divide a light beam into its component wavelengths in order to measure wavelengths. A diffraction grating is an example of such a device. An extremely high number of parallel lines that are evenly spaced and etched on a transparent surface make up a transmission diffraction grating. The plastic copies of a master grating that are utilised in this experiment are created by pressing the plastic up against the master grating, which serves as a mould. The behaviour of a diffraction grating is similar to that of a set of slits in an opaque screen.

# Formula

$\lambda=\frac{\sin(\theta)m}{nN}$
Where
$\lambda: \text{Wavelength}$
$\theta: \text{angle of diffraction}$
$n: \text{Order of maxima}$
$N: \text{Grating Element},\text{Number of lines per inch}(12.5A^0)\text{on grating}$
# Procedure:

- The preliminary adjustments of the spectrometer are made.
- Set the grating for normal incidence.
- Illuminate the slit with a mercury vapor lamp.
- Align the telescope with the collimator and ensure the direct image of the slit coincides with the vertical cross wire.
- Note the readings of one vernier and firmly clamp the vernier table.
- Rotate the telescope exactly 90° and fix it in this position.
- Mount the grating vertically on the prism table with its ruled surface facing the collimator.
- Release the vernier table and slowly rotate it until the reflected image coincides with the vertical cross wire.
- Adjust the leveling screws so that the image is centered in the field of view of the telescope.
- Fix the prism table and make fine adjustments with the tangential screw, then note the vernier readings.
- Set the angle of incidence to 45°.
- Release the vernier table and rotate it exactly 45° in the proper direction, making the surface of the grating normal to the incident light. Firmly clamp the vernier table in this position.
- Release the telescope and bring it to observe the direct image. 
- Observe the diffraction spectra on either side of the direct image.
- Slowly turn the telescope towards the left until the vertical cross wire coincides with the violet lines of the first order, and take the vernier readings.
- Align the vertical cross wire with the other lines on the left and record the vernier readings for each.
- Move the telescope to the right and similarly take the readings for different lines.
- Determine the difference between the readings on the left and right on the same vernier for each line.
- Calculate the mean value of this difference, which gives ${2\theta}$ (twice the angle of diffraction). Thus, determine the angle of diffraction ${\theta}$ for each spectral line.
- Calculate the number of lines per meter (${N}$) of the grating.
- Using the value of ${N}$, calculate the wavelengths of other prominent lines in this spectrum.

# Error:

$\% Error=\frac{Actual-Practical}{Actual}\times 100$
$\%Error=\frac{\left(5.3\cdot10^{-5}-4.87\cdot10^{-5}\right)}{5.3\cdot10^{-5}}\cdot100=8.1\%$

# Result:

The wavelength of yellow = $5.6 \times 10^{-5}$ m
The wavelength of green =$6.5 \times 10^{-5}$ m
The wavelength of violet =$4.43 \times 10^{-5}$ m


# Precautions and improvements:
1. **Spectrometer Setup**: Ensure the spectrometer is properly calibrated before starting the experiment. Adjust the collimator and telescope to ensure accurate alignment.
2. **Handling the Grating**: Handle the diffraction grating carefully to avoid fingerprints or scratches on the surface, which can affect the diffraction pattern.
3. **Light Source**: Use a stable and coherent light source (Mercury vapor or Sodium lamp) to avoid fluctuations in light intensity, which may lead to errors in observation.
4. **Spectrometer Adjustments**: Ensure the spectrometer is leveled using the spirit level to avoid angular errors in measurements.
5. **Fine Adjustments**: Use fine adjustment screws when aligning the telescope and Vernier table to ensure precise readings of the spectral lines.
6. **Avoid Parallax Error**: Always take the readings while keeping your eye in line with the Vernier scale to avoid parallax error.
7. **Accurate Angle Measurement**: Rotate the Vernier table gently and stop as soon as the spectral lines coincide with the cross wire to avoid overshooting the angle.
8. **Read Both Sides**: Take readings from both the left and right sides of the direct image for each spectral line to minimize errors in calculating the angle of diffraction.
9. **Environmental Conditions**: Ensure the experiment is conducted in a draft-free and stable environment to avoid disturbances to the light source and apparatus.    
10. **Repeat Observations**: Take multiple readings and average them to improve the accuracy of the angle measurements.
