# Theory:
- **Total Internal Reflection**: Optical fibers transmit light based on total internal reflection. Light reflects within the fiber when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle of the medium.

- **Material Selection**: The optical fiber material is chosen according to the transmission wavelength range.

- **Numerical Aperture (NA)**:
  - Defines the fiber's light-gathering ability.
  - Determines the maximum angle at which light is totally internally reflected and transmitted.
  - NA is the sine of the acceptance angle, forming a cone within which light must strike for proper transmission.

- **Bending Effects**:
  - Bending changes the light’s incidence angle on the fiber’s surface.
  - Increased curvature (sharper bends) reduces the incidence angle, causing loss of total internal reflection.
  - When the incidence angle drops below the critical angle, refraction occurs, leading to power loss and increased attenuation due to light escaping the fiber.


# Procedure 1:
1. Make all the connections.
2. Connect one end of the optical fiber cable to the NA trainer board source and the other end to the NA Jig.
3. Place the NA Scale on the NA jig at different positions (2 mm, 4 mm, 6 mm) and count the no. of concentric circles vertically covered by the red spot.
4. Record L (the distance of the screen from the fiber end) and W (diameter of the spot) values in the below observation tables.
# Procedure 2:



# Formula
$$N_{A}=\frac{W}{\sqrt{ W^2 +4L^2}}$$

# Error propagation:
$\Delta W=0.2$
$\Delta L=0.1$

$$
\frac{\Delta W}{W}\times
$$
