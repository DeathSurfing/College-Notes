# Aim:
Determine the specific charge(e/m) of an electron by the Thomson Method

# Apparatus:
- Cathode Ray Tube(CRT)
- Wooden Stand
- Wooden box x2
- Power Supply
- Bar Magnets
- Compass box

# Theory

### Electron Gun:
The electron gun in the CRT generates a beam of electrons by heating a cathode, which emits electrons through thermionic emission. These electrons are then accelerated and focused into a narrow beam by an anode.
### The Screen:

The screen is coated with a fluorescent material that glows when struck by electrons, allowing the path of the electron beam to be visualized.
### Deflecting System:
The deflecting system consists of parallel plates for the electric field and coils or magnets for the magnetic field. These systems control the deflection of the electron beam, enabling measurements of its motion under different conditions.


# Formula:

$$\frac{e}{m}=\frac{Vy}{lLH^2d}\times10^{7}\ \ \ \frac{emu}{gm}$$
Where $H=H_e \tan(\theta)$ ;

$H_e=\text{magnetic field strenght at where the lab is performed}$
$L=\text{Length of the horizontal pair of plate}$
$V=\text{Voltage applied across the plates}$
$H=\text{Intensity of applied field}$
$Y=\text{total deflection}$
$D=\text{Seperation of two plates}$

# Procedure:

1. **Setup the CRT:** Place the cathode ray tube on a wooden stand and connect it to the power supply.
2. **Generate Electron Beam:** Switch on the power supply to produce and visualize the electron beam on the fluorescent screen.
3. **Apply Electric Field:** Introduce an electric field using the deflecting plates and observe the deflection of the beam.
4. **Apply Magnetic Field:** Place bar magnets around the CRT to create a perpendicular magnetic field and note the deflection.
5. **Balance the Deflections:** Adjust the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields until the electron beam travels undeflected.
6. **Record Measurements:** Measure the accelerating voltage, distance between the plates, and magnetic field strength.
7. **Calculate e/me/m:** Use the recorded values to determine the specific charge of the electron.
