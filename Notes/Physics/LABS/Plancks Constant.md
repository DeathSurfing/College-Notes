- D.C. Power Supply  
- Set of filters and filter stand  
- Light source

### 3. Theory:  
The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from the surface of a material when light falls on it. These emitted electrons are termed *photoelectrons*.  
- When light is directed at a target metal plate (T) in a vacuum tube, electrons are ejected from the surface.  
- These electrons are collected by a collector electrode (C) placed opposite the target, generating a photocurrent measured by an ammeter.  
- By applying a negative potential to the collector, the kinetic energy of the electrons can be measured.  
- The negative potential at which the photocurrent becomes zero is called the *stopping potential* $(V_s)$.  

The photoelectric equation is expressed as:  
$$ h\nu = h\nu_0 + E_{\text{max}} $$  
or  
$$ h\nu = W_0 + eV_s $$  

Where:  
- $\nu$: Frequency of incident light  
- $W_0$: Work function of the material  
- $V_s$: Stopping potential  
- $e$: Charge of the electron  

Rearranging for $V_s$:  
$$ V_s = \left( \frac{h}{e} \right)\nu - \left( \frac{W_0}{e} \right) $$  
This is in the form of $Y = mx + c$, where the slope $m = \frac{h}{e}$.  
Thus,  
$$ h = e \cdot \text{slope} \quad \text{(in Joule-seconds)} $$

### 4. Procedure:  
#### For Planck's Constant:  
1. Make the circuit connections as per the circuit diagram. Adjust the ammeter and voltmeter readings to zero before switching on the light source.  
2. Arrange the light source. Adjust the distance between the tube and the light source to ensure a deflection between 40 to 80 µA.  
3. Insert a filter of known wavelength (e.g., $\lambda_1$) into the slit provided.  
4. Observe the deflection in the micro-ammeter at zero anode potential.  
5. Slowly vary the D.C. voltage using the knob and observe the current. The current should decrease as the voltage increases.  
6. Note the voltage value when the current becomes zero. This is the stopping potential $V_1$.  
7. Repeat the experiment with other filters of different wavelengths (e.g., $\lambda_2, \lambda_3$) and note their stopping potentials $V_2, V_3$.  
8. Plot a graph with frequency ($\nu$) on the x-axis and stopping potential ($V_s$) on the y-axis.  
9. Calculate Planck's constant $h$ using the slope of the graph and the given formula.  

#### Given Data:  
- $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}$  
- $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$
