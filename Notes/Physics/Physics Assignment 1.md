# Q1.
### i) Construction:
1. Light source (monochromatic)
2. Double slits (parallel, equal width)
3. Screen (distant, to observe interference pattern)

### Working:
1. Light passes through double slits, creating two coherent sources.
2. Interference occurs between light waves from each slit.
3. Interference pattern (fringes) appears on the screen.

### Key Components:
1. Wavelength ($\lambda$)
2. Distance between slits ($d$)
3. Distance from slits to screen ($L$)
4. Slit width ($\beta$ )

### Fringe Positions
- **Central Bright Fringe:**
  - $x = 0$ (Center of screen)

- **n-th Bright Fringe:**
  - $x = \frac{n \lambda L}{d}$
  - where $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$

- **n-th Dark Fringe:**
  - $x = \frac{(2n - 1) \lambda L}{2d}$
  - where $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$
