## Introduction:
### Classical Physics:
- Deals with larger sized objects and consists of mostly newtonian physics
### Quantum physics:
- Deals with small sized objects closer to the Planck length object and mostly deals with Special theory of relativity.
### Dual nature of light:
- Light acts as both wave and particle in circumstances
- For example
	- Light acts as a particle in the photoelectric effect
		- $h\nu=K.E+W$
		- Where $W=h\nu_{0}$
		- Which is same as $K.E=h(\nu-\nu_{0})$
	- Light acts as a wave in interference (Young double slits experiment)


### Compton scattering:
$\lambda_{f}-\lambda_{i}=\Delta \lambda=\frac{h}{m_{0}c}(1-\cos \theta)$


## Quantum View of particles and waves



## De-Broglie hypothesis
