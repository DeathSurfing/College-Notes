## Introduction:
### Classical Physics:
- Deals with larger sized objects and consists of mostly newtonian physics
### Quantum physics:
- Deals with small sized objects closer to the Planck length object and mostly deals with Special theory of relativity.
### Dual nature of light:
- Light acts as both wave and particle in circumstances
- For example
	- Light acts as a particle in the photoelectric effect
		- $h\nu=K.E+W$
		- Where $W=h\nu_{0}$
		- Which is same as $K.E=h(\nu-\nu_{0})$
	- Light acts as a wave in interference (Young double slits experiment)


### Compton scattering:
$\lambda_{f}-\lambda_{i}=\Delta \lambda=\frac{h}{m_{0}c}(1-\cos \theta)$

## De-Broglie hypothesis
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{p}$$
Where p is the momentum
$\lambda$ is the wavelength
h is Planck constant ($6.62607015×10^{-34}JHz^{-1}$)


## Basic postulates of quantum mechanics


## Heisenbergs uncertainty principle
Both position and momentum cant be figured out simultaneously for microscopic(Quantum) objects.
$$\Delta x\Delta px\geq \frac{h}{4\pi}$$
## Wave function
- Denoted by the letter $\psi$ 
- Is a complex function

$$\psi=A+Bi$$
$\psi^*=|\psi|$
$\psi^{*}=A-BI$
$|\psi|^2=|\psi*\psi|$ is the probability of 
$|\psi^2|=A^2+B^2$

#### Normalised condition
$\int\psi^*\psi dx=1$

#### Orthogonal condition: 
$\int\psi^*\psi dx=0$

### Properties of the wave function:
- $\psi$ must be finite
- $\psi$ must be continuous
- $\psi$ must be a single value
- $\psi$ must be square integrable
