# Active and Passive elements:

## Content
There are two types of elements,
### Active Element:
- Generate supply
### Passive element:
- Absorb the supply
# Directed graphs
- Have incoming and outgoing current
- Showcases the flow of current
# Non-directed graphs
- Don't have outgoing current and incoming current
- Do not showcase the flow of current
# Rank of a graph:
Let n be the number of nodes
$rank=n-1$
# Degree of node
- The number of incoming branches

# Degree of a graph:
- Number of branches in the graph
- The sum of degrees of all nodes

# Incidence matrix:

| Node/Branch | a   | b   | c   | d   | e   | f   |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1           | 1   | 0   | 0   | -1  | 0   | -1  |
| 2           | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | -1  | 0   |
| 3           | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 4           | -1  | -1  | -1  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

The sum of columns in any incidence matrix must be 0

# Reduced Incidence matrix:
Eliminate any one row from the incidence matrix
