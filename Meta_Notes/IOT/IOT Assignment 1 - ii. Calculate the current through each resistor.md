# ii. Calculate the current through each resistor

## Content

- Current through $R_1$: $I_1 = 14 A$
- Current through $R_2$: $I_1 - I_2 = 14 - 12.5 = 1.5 A$
- Current through $R_3$: $I_2 = 12.5 A$
- Current through $R_4$: $I_2 - I_3 = 12.5 - 13.25 = -0.75 A$ (flowing in opposite direction)
- Current through $R_5$: $I_3 = 13.25 A$

### **Q3: Superposition Theorem**

1. **Step 1 (V1 Active)**:  
$$I_{V1} = \frac{12V}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{12}{5 + 2} = \frac{12}{7} = 1.71A$$

2. **Step 2 (V2 Active)**: 
    $$I_{V2} = \frac{6V}{R_2 + R_3} = \frac{6}{2 + 6+1} = \frac{6}{9} = 0.66A$$
3. $I_{1}=3A$:
4. **Step 4:Super position of currents:**
	$I_{total\ through\ 5\Omega }=1.71-3=-1.286A$
Current through $5\Omega$ resistor = 1.286A
