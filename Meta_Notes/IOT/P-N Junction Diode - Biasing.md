# Biasing

## Content
- Applying a external voltage to a P-N junction diode
	- Forward biasing is when the P side is connected to the positive side and N side is connected to negative side of a battery; Creates a narrow depletion region
	- Reverse Bias P type is connected to negative and P type is connected to the positive side of a battery; Creates a wide narrow depletion region
